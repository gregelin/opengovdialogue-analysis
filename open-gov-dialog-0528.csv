2420-4049	Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and other mental illnesses can be cured naturally	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Dear Barack:<br /><br />I am a person that, by my own efforts, overcame bipolar disorder via natural means in the late 1990's. In doing so, I learned how to properly treat both depression and bipolar disorder in most persons that are so afflicted. (My knowedge in these two regards is "world leading", and it has been world leading for over nine years.)<br /><br />In 2004, I taught my (then thirteen year old) son Willy how to cure himself in regard to his ADHD diagnosis, classic bipolar symptoms, and weak and sickly childhood health. <br /><br />Willy has generated a recovery story that "the whole world needs to hear". As a result of some simple biological knowledge that I taught him on weekends and his own efforts (I am a non-custodial father), Willy went from a "basket-case child", both mentally and physically, to one of the healthiest, happiest, and strongest young men in his entire high school.<br /><br />Willy's "before and after pictures" on two blogs on http://360.yahoo.com/allen_dar show the above point well. These blogs are:<br /><br />Willy's Three Year ADHD/Bipolar Recovery Story<br /><br />http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-Kgb7fcYwd6q.3mLsjmULpwU-?cq=1&p;=235<br /><br />Doctors Helped Cause Willy's Sickness; A Picture When He Was Not Well<br /><br />http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-Kgb7fcYwd6q.3mLsjmULpwU-?cq=1&p;=226<br /><br />Willy and I have found out that what we are doing to achieve physical and mental health applies to many other persons (millions).<br /><br />The truth is that nutrients can profoundly correct rather severe depressive, bipolar, and schizophrenic symptoms within a matter of hours to a matter of days. (No drug in the world can do what nutrients and other natural measures can do in these regards, or come even close.)<br /><br />Someone had to eventually figure out how to cure severe mental illness symptoms via natural means... and that someone had to "be one of us" (those of us affected by such illnesses). <br /><br />I am that "someone" in the paragraph above. My son is "solid anecdotal proof" of what I am representing in this regard. So are other persons that are doing what we are doing (or similar) supplement-wise and otherwise.<br /><br />Drug oriented medicine is the biggest hoax in history. It has no cures for a myriad of illnesses, despite the fact that it pretends to know what it is talking about.<br /><br />It is no accident that I have had extraordinary difficulty staying online since I first widely posted my son Willy's amazing recovery story to the Internet in June 2006. Since this time, I have had six different personal computers of my own hacked into and/or disrupted, and I have had three computers of family members attacked while I was using them as well. I have also been hacked while using numerous computers in two public libraries near me. <br /><br />The above computer difficulties apparently stem from Big Pharma monitoring the growth of alternative medical truth on the Internet, and doing all it can to slow this growth of truth down.<br /><br />Big Pharma does not want the fact that mental illness can be cured naturally be found out by the masses. If this truth is found out, drug oriented medicine is doomed, and "they" know it.<br /><br />These people most certainly know that if you, as the President of the U.S., hear what my son, I, and some other people have to say in regard to how to properly resolve mental illness and addiction via natural means that drug oriented medicine, as we know it today, is doomed.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I cannot recommend enough that you set up an open forum in Washington, D.C. to hear what alternative medicine has to say on a number of topics. (For example, did you know that medicating high cholesterol is considered a hoax by a number of doctors in the alternative medical arena. Medicating high blood pressure is also considered a hoax by knowledgeable alternative medical practitioners. And medicating acid reflux disease is considered a hoax as well. These three classes of fraudulent medications are only the beginning of the enormous hoax being pulled on us by "Big Medicine" and Big Pharma.)<br /><br />My recovery experience, my son Willy's recovery experience, as well as the recovery experiences of a number of other persons, offers overwhelming anecdotal proof that antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotic medications are all fraudulent as well.<br /><br />Barack, ONLY YOU have the power and the means to correct this enormous problem of natural cures being shut out by the federal law that "ONLY A DRUG can diagnose, prevent, treat, or cure a disease".<br /><br />America needs to become legally open to what nutrients and other natural measures have to to offer in regard to curing disease. If this does not occur, it is inevitable that we are going to become a second class nation as a result of (1) a populace that is becoming less healthy mentally and physically generation after generation, and (2) a populace that is bankrupted by high medical costs.<br /><br />God help us all if you cannot hear what alternative medicine in general, and persons such as myself, are saying.<br /><br />And God help us all if Big Pharma succeeds in getting healing nutritional supplements taken out of the public domain in the U.S., as they have succeeded in doing in many other countries around the world.<br /><br />This issue of what chemical agents best cure disease, drugs vs. nutrients and other natural measures, is an issue that MAY NEED TO BE PROPERLY ADDRESSED BY YOU if our planet has a ghost of a chance of being saved. It is that important.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Allen Darman<br /><br />http://360.yahoo.com/allen_dar<br /><br />Email: allen_dar@yahoo.com<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The idea I am submitting would contribute to the health and the recovery of millions of persons that suffer from depression, bipolar disorder, and other mental illnesses. It would also contribute to the health and the recovery of millions of persons that suffer from a myriad of addictions (alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc.).<br /><br />The simple truth is that drugs can only mask (hide) the symptoms of severe mental illness, while nutrients and other natural measures can profoundly cure such.</div><br />	allen_dar	-73	20	93	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2420-4049	
2421-4049	Immigration	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Review the current interview process for immigrants abroad. Currently the decision to grant or deny a visa rests solely with the immigration officer conducting the interview. The denial is often times based on opinion not fact. This leaves the applicant and the beneficiary very little options on how to defend the denial if they don't have a specific reason for the denial.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>My brother is married to US Citizen and his visa was denied based on 221(g). Failing to establish a bona fide relationship. What does that mean? How can one prove a relationship is "bona fide" if they do not know what made it NOT BONA FIDE in the first place?

2422-4049	Hold Agencies Accountable for Implementing the Open Government Directive	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Leadership and oversight at the highest levels of the federal government will be necessary for the Open Government Directive to succeed. The Presidentâ&euro;&trade;s Management Council, which is made up of the Deputy Secretaries of all major agencies, should oversee the implementation of the directive to ensure that the entire federal government is working together to manage the implementation of the directive. <br /><br />All agencies should provide regular public reports on their progress towards implementing the Open Government Directive. Existing performance measurement and scorecard systems should be modified to include transparency, participation and collaboration criteria and metrics. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	jgoldman	261	320	59	10	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2422-4049

2424-4049	Encourage State and Local Governments to Become More Open and Inclusive	2009-05-20 00:00:00	President Obama's historic commitment to open government has inspired people across the country with a renewed belief that government can and should be transparent, participatory and collaborative. In Seattle, WA, the City Council has formed an Open Government Committee to explore and recommend ways to improve citizens' access to public documents and seek more diverse community input on issues affecting the city in advance of legislative action. In Owensboro, KY, citizens have signed an Open Government Pledge and asked local government leaders to adopt a set of principles committing to more transparent and participatory practices.<br /><br />As President Obama develops and implements his Open Government Directive, he should support local governments in doing the same by offering guidance for the steps that cities, towns and counties can take to become more transparent, participatory and collaborative. The President should convene mayors, city administrators, city council members, county executives and county commissioners who have distinguished themselves for their commitment to open government principles. This Local Open Government Commission would pursue the following objectives:<br /><br />1. Develop a set of Open Government Principles that may be adopted by local governments <br /><br />2. Develop a set of Open Government Best Practices in the areas of Transparency, Participation, and Collaboration<br /><br />3. Develop an Open Government Seal of Approval that may be awarded to those local governments that demonstrate a commitment to open government principles by adopting the best practices described above<br /><br />4. Create a program to recognize local leaders for excellence in open government<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Many decisions that impact people's lives are made at the local and state level. The Open Government Directive is a great opportunity for the federal government to encourage local and state governments to encourage greater participation and collaboration.</div><br />	jgoldman	364	431	67	20	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2424-4049	
2425-4049	4. Convene the American Public in National Discussions of One Million People or More on the Issues of Highest Public Concern	2009-05-20 00:00:00	A healthy democracy needs the capacity to involve its citizens in key decisions. Government cannot be left to leaders, experts, and pundits with the public only weighing in on election day. People from all walks of life should be encouraged to wrestle with tough questions, seek common ground, and develop and articulate their views.<br /><br />President Obama should call for regular national discussions of one million Americans or more on the issues of highest public concern, like foreign policy, energy, taxes, health care, and jobs. Every citizen should have a seat at the table. National Discussions could be one of the signature initiatives of the Open Government Directive that signals a new way of governing. <br /><br />National discussions will use a variety of methods to ensure that more than one million Americans can take part in a meaningful way. Some people will weigh in by participating in massive national town meetings that link gatherings around the country together by satellite, so that Americans in Buffalo can speak with Americans in San Jose, Boise, Birmingham and other communities around the nation. Others will host their own conversations in their homes, places of work or community centers. In small groups, they will wrestle with the challenges facing our nation and then submit their ideas over the Internet. Still others who cannot attend the national discussion in person will join the process online, where they will work with a small group in a virtual discussion space before registering their priorities.<br /><br />Each National Discussion will engage Americans from every walk of life and every corner of the nation. By providing so many people with a meaningful voice, we can help restore public trust in our governing institutions and energize the civic spirit of America.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>On the issues of highest public concern - foreign policy, taxes, health care, jobs - Americans have no formal way to wrestle with the choices facing policy makers and articulate their collective preferences as a nation. All too often, the health of our democracy is measured by participation in elections, rather than the ability of our governing institutions to represent the collective interests of the American people. Our democracy doesn't and shouldn't end after Election Day. It should provide the public with a real voice in our nation's policy making process while offering our representatives with a firm mandate to govern. </div><br />	jgoldman	203	312	109	17	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2425-4049	
2426-4049	Social Media and the Government	2009-05-20 00:00:00	In order to foster better dialogue between government agencies and the individuals they serve, encourage and foster the use of Social Media. Reduce the restrictions currently placed on government employees in accessing various social media sites, and allow departments and individuals to extend the voice of the government to the people through various new media outlets.

2428-4049	3. Create Incentives and a Recognition Program to Promote Participation, Collaboration and Transparency Among Federal Agencies	2009-05-20 00:00:00	The Federal Government should celebrate those agencies and federal managers who demonstrate a strong commitment to open government and develop new innovations for working with the public. An annual award should honor excellence in open government. The award should contain criteria requiring broad-based collaboration and community involvement, innovation, and promotion of best practices that result in outcomes that advance the Presidentâ&euro;&trade;s agenda. Incentives to pilot new public engagement and collaboration programs should be created, like a competition for funding and the creation of senior leadership competency requirements that focus on participation and collaboration skills.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>A risk averse culture within the federal government reduces the ability of federal managers to experiment with new methods of public participation and collaboration. Many managers in federal agencies do not perceive or appreciate the benefits of participation and believe that these processes exacerbate risks of delay, public controversy or mistakes that may result in reprisals or negative career repercussions. Steps must be taken to create new incentives and remove disincentives to pursue greater participation and collaboration within federal agencies. </div><br />	jgoldman	176	224	48	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2428-4049	
2429-4049	Florida's Open Government Model	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Gov. Charlie Crist created the Office of Open Goverment on his first day as Gov. The Office's primary functions are to assure full and expeditious compliance with Florida's open government and public records laws, and to provide training to all executive agencies under the Gov.'s purview on transparency and accountability. Each agency was directed to designate a person at the agency who will act as the agency's public records/open government contact person. That individual will be responsible for complying with public records/open government requests and compliance at their respective agency and will also be the primary liaison between that agency and the Office of Open Government for purposes of training and compliance. Phone #s and emails for agency contacts are posted on website as well as other useful information. Great model to replicate on local, state and federal levels. http://www.flgov.com/og_home <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Membersof the public have a person in each agency to assist them in accessing agency documents and meetings.</div><br />	carrinj	25	47	22	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2429-4049	
2430-4049	Establish the President’s Management Council as the key oversight structure for creating a more open government	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Establish the President's Management Council as the key oversight structure for creating a more open government. The President's Management Council can effectively engage Deputy Secretaries of the cabinet-level departments and agencies, providing top-level management support for open government. As the key Executive Branch official, the Chief Performance Officer should take responsibility for directing the overall Open Government Directive. With the support of the Chief Performance Officer, the Council will work with the top federal managers to plan and guide the implementation of the directive across the federal government.<br /><br />Form three inter-agency work groups to carry out the main aspects of the directive with the President's Management Council.<br /><br />1. The first work group, chaired by the Office of Management and Budget, will oversee implementation of the Open Government Directive and measure its progress. OMB will provide policies, guidance, resources and performance measures necessary for the federal government to implement the Open Government Directive. Among the responsibilities of this work group will be: (a) make available additional funding to launch this initiative, (b) develop performance measures that recognize and validate effective actions, innovations and policies, (c) provide federal agencies with incentives that will recognize and reinforce progress, and (d) gather and distribute best practices and lessons learned as related to planning and implementing the Open Government Directive.<br /><br />2. The second work group, chaired by the Office of Personnel Management, will build the capacity of federal employees to engage the public. This workgroup will: (a) Define competencies needed; develop a shared vocabulary and knowledge base; develop training requirements addressed by the Office of Personnel Management's various training centers (including collaborative training through inter-agency efforts); ensure efforts are multi-disciplinary; and provide incentives to reward federal employees who successfully implement the Open Government Directive, and (b) Gather, organize and distribute the best practices and lessons learned related to building personnel capacity to reach out to the public.<br /><br />3. The third work group on technology issues related to open government, chaired by the Chief Technology Officer, will investigate enhancing public participation through the use of new technologies such as Web 2.0 and social media channels. This workgroup will: (a) Serve as the starting point for benchmarking, learning lessons, and identifying best practices for technology and government, and (b) Examine collaborations with citizen-experts in the emerging media and technology sectors.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Oversight, promotion and management of the Open Government Directive within the federal bureaucracy are critical to its success. Agencies have many competing priorities and directions. Creating a government that is truly open to the concerns and ideas of its citizens depends on effective policies, guidance, resources, and measures being implemented throughout the federal government. </div><br />	jgoldman	-4	30	34	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2430-4049	
2431-4049	Use CRADA agreements to allow Open Source Community to help make govt data transparent	2009-05-20 00:00:00	The government allows "Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA) to bring together government and public researchers to work on joint projects in which no money changes hands. CRADA agreements allow both parties to share in the resultant research. CRADA agreements should be used to allow developers in the open source community and elsewhere to come in and aid Federal Agencies in making their data transparent. Many agencies aren't funded to make their data transparent, and likewise, many citizens and interest groups want to participate and collaborate in helping the Federal government. <br /><br />CRADA agreements could allow the process of extracting (often unstructured) data to be Open Source, while the data itself resides on data.gov. Many in the open source community already support this idea.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This allows the government to take advantage of the expertise of its citizenry for free, while building better trust between govt agencies and citizens, AND increasing the flow of transparent data.</div><br />	ndickover	46	68	22	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2431-4049	
2433-4049	Centralize petitions to Congress and the President	2009-05-20 00:00:00	I worked as an intern in the House of Representatives and what astonished me the most was the outdated system we use for alerting representatives to the problems faced by the American people. Every day, each member of Congress receives hundreds of letters, some through e-mail, some handwritten, asking for a response to a very small number of issues. Most of these issues demand collaboration between many members of Congress. Wouldn't it be more efficient for citizens to demand change collectively, through the Internet? The British government already has a website like this at http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/. There, the Prime Minister can respond to petitions voted on by thousands of people. Obama has already done something like this by soliciting questions for his open dialogues--why not expand this tool to all of government?<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This would allow Americans to express interest in federal issues collectively rather than flooding their representatives with mail.</div><br />	averym	176	223	47	14	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2433-4049

This institute can track collaboration at every stage, including intergovernmental, cross-jurisdictional and within individual agencies.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Agencies need a resource to offer training and disseminate best practices in participation and collaboration</div><br />	jgoldman	72	106	34	8	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2434-4049	
2435-4049	Fully fund participation and collaboration activities	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Agencies generally do not adequately plan for or budget to integrate public participation or collaborative processes into their programmatic work. To undertake small and large-scale public participation or collaborative efforts, agencies often have to re-program personnel and dollars or look to other program sources, effectively "robbing Peter to pay Paul." <br /><br />Additionally, many public participation and collaborative efforts are long-term in nature and annual budget cycles do not generally allow for budgeting for multi-year processes.<br /><br />For public participation to be done well, adequate resources must be dedicated for this purpose. Funding is needed to support new uses of technology, education and skills training, travel, administrative support, and expert assistance such as facilitators.<br /><br />By soliciting public input, the Open Government Directive promises to make government more efficient, reducing costs related to overlooked information or stakeholders, lengthy campaigns to educate the public after the fact, and concealed redundancies. Therefore, a significant initial investment, may promise to pay for itself over a period of years. OMB should work with the other task forces and oversight groups to determine this window of years and track the savings provided to the tax-paying public. This will also serve to provide greater incentive for Americans participate in open government, by providing high-level input. <br /><br />Recommendations for action, developed in April 2009 by federal agency managers attending "Champions of Participation":<br /><br />1. Direct agencies to incorporate participation and collaboration into funding requests and major project planning, such as: in the formulation and justification of budget requests funding; in the process of planning any large projects (such as planning processes, environmental studies, rulemakings) thereby building the public participation strategy into the life of the project; <br /><br />2. Direct agencies to use at least 1% of program budgets for implementation of the directive and specify the resource needs to support public participation and collaboration including full-time positions for subject matter experts, basic education and skills training, technology tools to increase transparency, public participation and collaboration, and other capacity building needs.<br /><br />3. Set standards for the amount of funding that will be dedicated to participation and collaboration activities, such as: study how participation and collaboration dollars are already being spent; provide resources and formulas that allow agencies to track savings and/or efficiency; use agency collected data to set standards.<br /><br />4. Create new funding sources for participation and collaboration, such as: public-private partnerships, use attrition to shift more full-time positions to new positions that focus on using collaborative approaches and public participation strategies; develop a fund for the purpose of supporting public participation and collaboration across agencies.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	shaaslyons	272	336	64	7	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2435-4049

Integrate Participation and Collaboration into All Major Systems of Federal Agencies	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Creating a more open government will require most federal agencies to fundamentally shift how they interact with the public. Within 180 days, agencies should produce a plan to integrate public involvement and collaboration into all relevant systems, including: <br /><br />• Hiring, recruiting and promotion <br />• Performance agreements and appraisal <br />• Award and incentive systems <br />• Rotations and special assignments<br />• Program assessment and audits<br />• Training and leadership development programs<br />• Communications strategies<br />• Strategic planning and budget processes<br /><br />Every agency should designate a senior level leader to serve as an open government champion. The champion will review agency operations and identify areas to improve public participation, collaboration and transparency activities. The agency champion will serve an on interagency working group to share best practices across agencies.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Changing the culture of the federal government to value and support participation and collaboration will require system-wide shifts in how agencies do business. </div><br />	jgoldman	187	248	61	8	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2437-4049

Have CIOs report the progress of their projects on a monthly basis to OMB. Examples of criteria: project must be within 5% of budget, project may not be over schedule by more than 2 weeks, detailed requirements were captured prior to the start of development, functionality delivered is correct and operating per requirements.<br /><br />ISSUE<br />Many projects are too massive and complex which results in a high failure rate, costing hundreds of millions of dollars and lengthy delays.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION<br />Every successful complex system started as a successful simple system. Deliver only the functionality required to be successful. This allows people to be productive in a short period of time. Require projects be broken down into modular units that can be delivered in 6-12 months. Provide criteria, based on private sector best practices, on what constitutes a modular unit.<br /><br />ISSUE<br />Agencies have improved their efficiency by using the systems of other agencies via the various government Lines of Business (LOBs) such as payroll and travel systems. However, outside of the LOBs, agencies do not have any motivation for researching whether other agencies have a solution that may also work for them. This results in money and resources which could have been better spent.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION<br />Develop a government-wide website and require all agencies to post a description of the functionality of all of their IT systems, not just the purpose. This gives agencies a central source of information to research a solution that solves at least 80% of their problem. By posting the system functionality, out of the box thinkers will be able to see systems they could use for other purposes. All agencies should be required to demonstrate to OMB they've done their homework before they are allowed to buildsystems from scratch. This will force the agencies to put more forethought into planning, reduce costs, implement solutions more quickly, and improve efficiency.<br /><br />ISSUE<br />Mark Forman, a previous administrator of the E-Government & Information Technology Office at OMB, identified the fact that 30% or more of IT dollars are spent on:<br /><br />Systems that are adjuncts to existing systems that don't provide the data needed by managers to perform their jobs<br />Ill conceived systems that are buried in the business cases of existing larger systems to escape detection and scrutiny<br />Poorly designed systems with a low enough dollar threshold so as not to require a business case<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION<br />Have OMB improve their definition of the types of systems that require a business case to help prevent the burying of systems within the business case of larger systems. Hire more IT personnel at OMB to review the business cases to identify these situations. OMB should conduct a government-wide survey where people can anonymously report adjunct systems. This would identify the systems that have not delivered functionality as promised and warrant further investigation to ascertain whether they should continue to be funded or not.<br /><br />ISSUE<br />Many Employees have knowledge of systems that are over budget, way past schedule, and have not delivered the promised functionality. They may also know when the Earned Value Management numbers are being manipulated to show the project is not more than 10% over budget.

2443-4049	IT Certification Monopoly	2009-05-20 00:00:00	ISSUE<br />Some agencies are requiring all applicants to have a certification in project management from PMI as a prerequisite to applying for a IT project manager position, regardless of how many years of experience they have. Project management certifications from any other source is not being accepted. Some agencies feel if their project fails in any way they can say they did their due diligence by hiring a PMI certified project manager and escape responsibility. This greatly reduces the field of qualified, experienced candidates and results in people with a PMI certification, but less experience, getting the positions. It also sets up a monopoly for PMI and forces people to spend hundreeds of dollars when there is no justifiable need.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION<br />OMB and OPM should make wriiten statements emphasizing the importance of experience and that agencies should not use a PMI certification to screen out candidates.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Requiring specific IT certifications as a prerequisite for applying for government positions reduces the number of very qualified candidates that cannot afford the thousands of dollars these certifications cost. These certification do not guarantee the government will recruite the best candidates.

2444-4049	Release/index all unclassified Congressional Research Service reports	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Currently, many reports of the Congressional Research Service remain undisclosed to the public. Work with Congress to release all non-confidential research reports, past to present. Index each paper with OCR and a good search engine (maybe a cool IT modernization project), attach any relevant annotations (when the report was requested, by whom, any relevant hearings/testimonies on the report), and you're set. Cross-linking to C-SPAN's video database would be solid.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The Congressional Research Service is a professional cadre of researchers who work in an nonpartisan, project-to-project research capacity for Congress. They often get at the truth of a pressing national issue, and often write brief, but deeply informative reports. Having these reports available for the average citizen to learn more about, understand the context, and watch any relevant hearing/testimony will help the broader American republic to self-educate on issues of the day. Furthermore, it will lessen the demand for lobby groups who traditionally function as gatekeepers or clearinghouses for compelling information in a technical or otherwise complicated debate.</div><br />	solorzanomilton	87	113	26	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2444-4049

Putting this data online would provide more transparency on public spending. For example, popular websites would likely be more deserving of continued support, whereas unused websites might be properly targeted to cut funds. A good interface to this data might also help citizens find interesting or useful government information. For example, the usage data can be used to created something similar to Digg or Technorati so that popular web pages, government blog posts, or documents can be easily found and tracked over time.<br /><br />The actual web server logs should not be made available if they contain personally identifiable information, such as IP addresses.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Citizens benefit from having more open government.</div><br />	dcastro	104	134	30	5	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2445-4049

I would say the same of the Library of Congress--make sure that every item that has passed out of copyright is scanned and made available free online. And be creative with your indexing: I can imagine some fascinating opportunities to employ a bunch of 19th and 20th century historians to better annotate this database, and CS folks to break down the barrier between the archive and the Main Street library.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Imagine if the National Archives wasn't just a proper noun--not just a building in a city on the Potomac--but a household resource freely accessible to all.

2447-4049	Make the IRS auditors open and accountable to citizens	2009-05-20 00:00:00	The IRS is the opposite of an open government. They operate in a "we are always right" fashion and are nearly impossible to get help from. They have been created for a purpose to collect money for the people to help our nation of the people. However, they forgot along the way that the same people they treat with indifference and as a number are those that they are working for.<br /><br />First, the IRS should not deploy an assumption that every citizen is guilty until they themselves prove their own innocence. While this might be an efficient manner to operate within, this is providing a disservice to the citizen selected for examination. This does also mean that automated notices should be done away with. For example, some citizens get an automated notice that all of their charitable contributions are discarded and invalid along with the paperwork to pay the back taxes and fines associated with those contributions. The citizen was assumed guilty and they are able to try to prove their innocence by sending in their paperwork.<br /><br />Second, the IRS should work in as efficient and open of a process as they expect the citizens to be. For example, upon being audited the IRS expects the citizen to return documentation within 30 days by mail or fax. However, they are "not able to" confirm the receipt of that information for 3 weeks let alone respond to it. Websites and interactions to check on the status of the information should be available.<br /><br />Third, the IRS should allow for open communication to the people who can actually help. Upon being audited, many citizens are pointed to a toll free number they can call and talk to a representative that has nothing to do with the audit itself. This is not open and is also a disservice to citizens. <br /><br />Finally, the IRS should allow for an open way to give feedback on a particular auditor's performance. If an auditor was being unreasonable, there should be an open process to complain about an auditor. For example, if an auditor is being rude or insensitive to a citizen, they should have the right to easily file a complaint and have that complaint responded to.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The IRS is a service for the US citizens that they pay for. They then persecute many innocent citizens and treat them poorly without any recourse. They demand a lot of information but do not return any when needed. A citizen cannot get real status of their audit or talk to the person actually conducting the audit. A citizen also has no way to provide feedback about the IRS auditor. This is not how an open government should work.</div><br />	burckart	86	109	23	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2447-4049	
2449-4049	To fund health care, tax sugary sodas and (legalize and) tax marijuana	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Overconsumption of sugary soft drinks is a major contributor to obesity and related health issues, and is hence a big cause of out-of-control health care costs. A moderate tax on sugary soft drinks, and the elimination of the corn subsidies that make high-fructose corn syrup calories so cheap, will steer consumers to healthier alternatives. This is traditionally called a "sin tax".<br /><br />Similarly, while most Americans agree that marijuana consumption is not desirable, it is very clear that the costs of prohibition greatly outweigh the benefits. Legalizing and taxing marijuana will provide needed revenue for improving our health care system, and at the same time free up law enforcement to focus on more serious problems and relieve some of the strain on our prison system.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Because in a free country, people need to be free to choose to behave as they wish without violating the rights of others.

I don't understand why a super power like US would have an immigration system in which you wouldn't know when you will get your case processed. One month we receive a newsletter saying that EB2 and EB3 categories are current for India and the next month it goes back 4-5 years or becomes unavailable for the rest of the year. Why can't we have a transparent system where USCIS would give details - these are the total number of greencards we can give this particular year and this many applications we received !! You are at number X so you have to wait for Y number of days before you can get your particular stage processed (be it Labor, I-140 or 485). The status on your case on USCIS's website is also not detailed. It says - we have received your case and it's pending. It would really help if we can get something more in detail from USCIS.

This 72-hour review proposal, which would help to prevent taxpayer-funded outrages such as the empty "Airport for No One" in the congressional district of Democratic Rep.

Our agency was able to do so because we looked to the research community and the peer review process for guidance about whether a research breakthrough was valid, important and of interest to the public.<br /><br />1. To maintain transparency, it should be federal policy that all agencies never intentionally hide, diminish, under-publicize or reject scientific research, particularly research that is of import to the scientific community as determined by that community through peer review. <br /><br />2. To encourage participation, the federal government should establish mechanisms to make it easier for federal grant recipients to publicize the results of their work -- in all areas, not just science and technology, but also art, history and others. Too many incredible results stay only within their professional community, in part because of misunderstanding and a lack of knowledge about how to share results.<br /><br />3.

2475-4049	Gays in military	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Probably the worst example of lack of transparency is in regard to gays in the military. How can we even talk about transparency while we fire gays for simply being transparent? Talk about having our heads in the sand! We could have a national debate about the issue if the facts could be accessed.How many gays do we have in the military now? We can't even answer that simple question! We are so hypocritical, we can't even make a law excluding gays from the military. As much as we claim to love our men and women in uniform, how can we love them and still require they hide who they are while they fight and die for us?<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This is important because keeping gays in the military silenced deniesw them of their free speech, a fundamental right. When we discriminate against one group of human beings, everyone's humanity is diminished. The present status prevents us from even knowing the truth.</div><br />	sherryjblair	26	51	25	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2475-4049	
2476-4049	Establish a US Goverment-wide Intranet	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Today many US department/agencies (especially US foreign affairs, intelligence and military departments/agencies), and thousands of employees working for these agencies, currently share information and collaborate using a US government-hosted and provided inter-agency intranet known by the name "Intelink-U" (the "U" stands for unclassified, as there is another similar version of USG intranet that handles "classified" national security information that is known by the name "Intelink-S," for it handles up to "secret" level classified national security information).<br /><br />To facilitate the creation and encourage the use of such a US Government-wide intranet, I recommend that the existing Intelink-U intranet foundation be greatly expanded and strengthened; that appropriate management, infrastructure and resources needed to support this expanding USG-wide intranet be provided; and that the name for this USG-wide intranet be changed from "Intelink-U" to "USGovlink."<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Such a USG-wide intranet would greatly faciliate vital information sharing and collaboration across the entire US federal govenment. </div><br />	sheerindp	-12	20	32	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2476-4049	
2479-4049	Encourage the use of online dispute resolution technology to manage questions or problems associated with open/transparent gover	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Opening government to greater participation and scrutiny will, inevitably, lead to questions, challenges, and in some cases disputes regarding information, processes, and services associated with open government functions.<br /><br />Government agencies already operate with a mandate to develop and use alternative dispute resolution (ADR), and ADR programs currently are associated with workplace disputes, citizen input to rule making, etc.<br /><br />In keeping with President Obamaâ&euro;&trade;s emphasis on the use of technology as key to e-government and transparency in government, Executive Order 12988 should be amended or extended to require federal agencies to use online dispute resolution technology to handle questions, complaints, and interactions with citizens reacting to open government activity. Order 12988 gave the Department of Justice the responsibility to create alternative dispute resolution (ADR) programs across the Federal Government, beginning specifically with ADR programs attached to Federal Courts. Since the Order was issued, ADR use has expanded far beyond alternative approaches to litigation, and technology has become available to facilitate the use of ADR techniques online.<br /><br />It is important to plan for the fact that not every citizen will fully appreciate every act of an open government - there will be questions, challenges, and controversies, and it is imperative to build in ways to deal with them on the front end of open government planning.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Planning for disputes and questions related to open government activity is necessary to ensure that expectations of responsiveness as well as openness will be met. To ingnore the need for dispute resolution systems working for open government is to invite violated expectations and guarantee some level of discontent.</div><br />	drainey500	16	31	15	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2479-4049	
2481-4049	Make It Safe for Govt. Workers to Innovate to Save Money	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Federal departments can only become more Transparent, Participatory, and Collaborative with outsiders (citizens) unless those same things are adopted INTERNALLY. Those qualities can only show up on the *outside* if they are valued on the *inside*.<br /><br />However, federal departments do NOT have the internal openness that makes it *safe* for their employees (and those of contractors) to suggest ways to make their organizations "work better and cost less".<br /><br />Now, you don't have to work for the government to know that it can be dangerous to one's career to suggest to your boss (or your boss's boss) that their office is operating in a "less-than-optimum" way (i.e., that they might be wasting money, and don't even know it.)<br /><br />However, it is more dangerous for government workers to make such suggestions about "better ways" of doing work because, even if the idea is successful, it is the Public's money that will be seen as having been "wasted" in the past. And so, the employee's manager fears being second-guessed by higher-ups as to why didn't the manager recognize this "better way" earlier? And how is it that this "better way" came from a lower-paid underling?<br /><br />WATCH THE VIDEO: Here's a very good (satirical) video about "Barriers to Innovation" that, even though produced by a team at NASA, is easily recognized by virtually every federal employee (except the new ones). National Public Radio did a story on it (along with a link to the video)--> www.tinyurl.com/as3son<br /><br />SOLUTION: There needs to be a ONLINE SYSTEM system that allows government employees to raise ideas AND also protects their true identity. These systems already exist and Fortune 500 companies use them to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (following the WorldCom and Enron scandals). Anonymity is necessary because most government managers are comfortable with the status-quo and, quite naturally, take actions against those who would imply that current operations are somehow flawed. [BTW: The existing I.G. system is NOT safe.]<br /><br />Yes, there ARE some enlightened managers in govt. who do encourage innovation and continous improvement, but they are relatively RARE. The vast majority of managers are not so enlightened and, as a result, the average employee is acting VERY rationally when they decide to keep their ideas to themselves!<br /><br />And, BTW, those average employees will NOT start to act irrationally (by speaking up) just because the White House passes out awards to "champions" whose success is largely due to their blind luck in having an enlightened boss. There is no proof that V.P. Gore's "Golden Hammer" awards during the 1990's made any real change in the C.Y.A. mindset of federal managers.<br /><br />This idea is important because nothing ever changes for the better until someone first says "Hey, why don't try it this way?" And, because there is always room for improvement in any organization (some more than others), we need to hear ALL the ideas that people have for improvements, ESPECIALLY from those who are the most familiar with the existing operations.<br /><br />If the President wants to open up the operations of federal departments to allow for better public input and feedback, then he needs to give the "closet-innovators" working WITHIN those departments the same, if not MORE, of the freedom to challenge the status-quo without fear of reprisal.<br /><br />BOTTOM-LINE:<br /><br />If the President does NOT make it safe for federal employees to innovate (or to just point out waste), then they will NOT put their jobs on the line for him as "agents of change." If he wants to enlist them, then he must protect them from the enemies of change.<br /><br />FOR MORE INFO about achieving government transparency (both internally and externally)--> www.UStransparency.com<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Stephen Buckley	79	94	15	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2481-4049

2483-4049	Mandate open formats in all government documents	2009-05-20 00:00:00	The ability of citizens to read or fill out electronic documents from the government should *NOT* be dependent on their use of a particular company's office product. This is indirectly subsidizing said company by government fiat. All electronic documents from the government should be published in a vendor-neutral format fully supported by multiple companies and/or free software, to maximize the opportunity for citizen participation in the process. Examples would be PDF for read-only documents and the Open Document Format (ODF) for editable forms.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>By not restricting the visibility of electronic documents to users of a particular software product, you maximize the chances for participatory democracy.</div><br />	rkh	53	70	17	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2483-4049	
2486-4049	Address Legal Barriers That Impede Participation and Collaboration	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Certain laws and regulations, as well as the manner in which certain agencies interpret these laws and regulations, affect the ability of agencies to engage and collaborate with the public. Among these laws and regulations are the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Government in the Sunshine Act, the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), and the Anti-Pass-The-Hat Provision (in the Treasury Appropriations Bill). In addition, some individual agencies say their internal interpretation of government-wide laws may place constraints on better citizen participation (e.g., National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), FACA, etc.)<br /><br />The following recommendations were developed by a group of federal agency managers and staff at a conference on March 30-31 that was facilitated by AmericaSpeaks, Demos, Everyday Democracy and Harvard's Ash Institute for Democratic Governance and Innovation. <br /><br />Conduct a review of each department and agency to update program regulations and rules in accordance with applicable legal authorities and societal needs. Departments and agencies will also determine whether they impose explicit or implicit restrictions or impediments to greater citizen involvement in program, agency, or cross-agency efforts. Efforts might include planning, agenda setting, program analysis, program or service design, implementation, examining efficient and effective alternatives, and evaluation.<br /><br />Use the review to produce an inventory of (1) creative examples of models or alternatives and (2) possible barriers. Share this information among agencies and the public. The inventory will be organized into the following categories (for both model examples and barriers) imposed by: (1) government-wide laws or regulations; (2) policies administered by other agencies; (3) agency or program-specific laws or regulations; and (4) administratively by the department, agency, or program. Separately identify implicit barriers, such as long review cycles for administrative approvals, multiple approvals for action, inconsistent legal interpretations over time, etc. <br /><br />Post the inventory on the department or agency's website for public review and comment for an explicit number of days. Complete the review and resulting inventory in an explicit number of days from the signing of this directive. Share the inventory with the entity overseeing the implementation of the Open Government Directive, which will post this inventory, along with other agency inventories, on a website as a resource for other agencies. <br /><br />Based on the review described above, department and agency heads will develop plans to improve their citizen participation efforts. These plans should address the administrative barriers identified, best practices identified, and the use of new technologies. The department or agency may delegate implementation action to a designated champion, office, or task force designated for this purpose. That entity will report on progress on a semi-annual basis.<br /><br />In the case of government-wide laws or regulations, or requirements of other agencies (e.g. FACA, FOIA, Paperwork Reduction Act), these shall be referred to the entity overseeing the implementation of the Open Government Directive for resolution.<br /><br />In the case of FACA, some agencies have found that their legal counsels' interpretations of the statute are a barrier to participation and collaboration efforts. The White House Counsel should set parameters around FACA's interpretation in order to support greater collaboration and participation. The White House Counsel should provide trainings for legal counsels in the agencies on the interpretation of government-wide laws or regulations that impact participation and collaboration. <br /><br />In the case where government-wide laws or regulations are being interpreted differently by different agencies, the entity overseeing the implementation of the Open Government Directive will work with agencies to develop an agreed upon interpretation that will increase opportunities for citizen participation. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Small changes in interpretation of laws and regulations could make a significant difference in the ability of government agencies to pursue participatory and collaborative strategies. We need to remove barriers so that agency champions of participation can innovate. </div><br />	jgoldman	170	190	20	5	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2486-4049	
2487-4049	National Town Hall Meetings	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Hold National Town Hall meetings which would be conducted according to Robert's Rules of Order. The President would call a national town hall meeting, set the agenda including the issues to be discussed and will determine the number of states, counties and cities to be involved and specify the date and time of these meetings.<br /><br />CONDUCTING TOWN HALLS<br /><br />A person representing the President and members of Congress from the district would call each meeting to order, and put the question of who will be elected meeting chair to those attending. The meeting would then vote on who will be Chair and the Chair will read the agenda and divide the group up into policy issues or small groups of 5-10 people who will then elect group moderators who will lead the group in discussion and ensure Robert's Rules are followed.<br /><br />At a specified time the group will vote on their issues electronically or by voice vote. This will then be electronically passed to the group moderator or the group moderator will pass the information to the group moderator who will enter it electronically. <br /><br />Then the entire meeting will be called back to order and the Chair will lead a discussion of the issues as voted on by the various groups. Once discussion has been completed and everyone has had the opportunity to speak or the fixed time has been reached the Meeting Chair will put the question(s) to attendees who will vote on each issue either electronically (depending on the software being used) or in person. The issues and votes will then be entered into the computer if they haven't already and the President, members of Congress and other town halls will be able to see how each town hall voted.<br /><br />Then the President will call on the first town hall to obtain the floor by logging on and ask the Group Chair to present their conclusions. If he or members of Congress who are co-hosting the meeting have questions they would be able to ask them. <br /><br />The President would then go through the list of town hall meetings until each group has had the opportunity to speak at least once. Then the attendees of the national town hall would be asked to vote on what was discussed. This if at all possible would be done electronically or directly but either way the results would be electronically or manually entered into a computer.<br /><br />The President would then conclude the meeting, thank everyone for their time and turn the meeting back over to the town hall chairs. Each chair would then conclude the meeting.<br /><br />TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED<br /><br />Depending on the needs of each town hall the technology used may vary but the technology exists and the technology used by the town halls would vary based on size and current needs and resources yet the administration would provide each state, legislative district, or city town hall representative with basic to be used at the meeting. Depending on the size of the meeting the President may choose to provide each attendee with a voting machine (simple clickers which are inexpensive could also be used).<br /><br />HOW MANY ATTENDEES<br /><br />Depending on the issues and what the administration and members of Congress would like to accomplish anywhere from 1 to 1,000's of town hall meetings could attend the national town hall meeting. The number of attendees at each would vary but the administration could (on a first come, first serve) basis determine a fixed number of attendees at each of the town hall meetings.<br /><br />Let's assume that the President would like to hold one meeting in each state to be held at its State Capitol. The number he wishes to attend is 1,000. The town halls would be divided up into small groups of 10 (as I noted above) and the total number of groups at each town hall would be 10. These meeting would convene on the specified day and time with an agenda. <br /><br />The meetings would last or about 2 to 3 hours depending on the agenda and then they would link up with the White House, members of Congress and the other town halls through the chosen online medium. <br /><br />If each town hall would be allowed to address the President for 10 minutes that would be a total of 50 minutes of the President's time and a commitment of 3-4 hours of attendees time. The voting results would be provided to the President in aggregate form and he could use the information to make decisions or if he chooses he could ask the attendees to stay for a prolonged discussion that lasts for a few more hours.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />As you can see the idea could be tailored depending on specific circumstances and could be a major town hall involving millions of Americans in cities and states around the country or a town hall meeting with several legislative districts. I have tried to avoid going into the details of such town halls because that would detract from the simplicity of what can be done and which can be expanded to include millions of Americans.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Allow the President to hear and speak with average Americans through an online medium that allows for interchange of ideas.</div><br />	Edward	-22	12	34	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2487-4049

2494-4049	Local investment, Our homes, Controlled through sound banks, Accountability for our actions, and benefiting all of our Livelihoo	2009-05-20 00:00:00	The Plan-in a nutshell<br />1. Federal Government sets up a program (similar to Social Security accounts but no benefits except an account system) that puts these foreclosure loans in the hands of local institutions that have proven track records of financial responsibility. These assets should be managed by people who have a stake in their communities. Not only will these local bankers be able to put financial pressure where it is needed, but maintain social pressure and have more concern for maintaining the local economy. Make defaulting something that is locally not a responsible act. Big banks can't do this and don't care to do this. <br />2. People who default and have their loans cost us tax payers should have Social Security benefits and future wages taxed or garnished, now and in the future. More bite to declaring bankruptcy and loan default and our government needs to act now or all of property values are going to go down the drain. If the government pays for lower interest rates for borrowers who are at risk for default these people should have an extra amount tagged onto the end of their loan, which will be paid back with interest to the government. We need this to prevent a total melt down and it makes it fair for those who follow the rules and abide by their contract with their mortgage. Moral hazard needs to not only follow those who default, but also their lenders.<br />3. Some will fail, but those that have a sound board of directors, strong business ethics, and financial restraint will rise to the top. These are the tenants of our current financial system and we should continue on this path and not veer towards the belief that larger is better because it is too big to fail (a Bush Policy that should not be followed or believed and is pure and simple bull). <br />4. Have a government sponsored plan for those who are out of work to receive mortgage payment benefits similar to student loan deferrals. Interest accrues, but you don't default on your loan.<br /><br />Benefits of plan: Investors will be able to invest in these institutions that prove their worth, are allowed to grow and not suffocated by these oversized multinational institutions that grew too fast and played with all of our money like they were in Las Vegas at a craps table.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It is a time to think outside of the box rather than following the same worn path to ruin. Whoever came up with the TARP must have been an acolyte of big banks and bigger salaries for bankers school of management. Rather than a large patch "TARP" (too big to fail philosophy) to fix our current problem, we need new thinking that focuses on rewarding institutions that for many years have held together communities with their sound lending practices and fiscal responsibility. Across this great nation there are thousands of small local banks that have intimate knowledge of local markets and the means to manage potential risk to loan management. Please give these small banks a chance to manage the mess (backed by our federal government) and our current moribund economy that in large part has been created by large banks and credit rating agencies.<br /><br />Big banks have and continue to exasperate and expand the problem of home loan management because of their nebulous debt and financial chicanery. Our money (government funds) has been used to bail out large banks that have proven to be poor managers of wealth and its accompanying risk. Their scales of economy have proven to be beyond the scope of regulation and management.<br />As a guiding principal, only institutions with a history of fiscal due diligence and risk management should be considered for receiving government largesse and to give support to bad loans. It is paramount to let the big banks lose market share (fail) because of their own misguided investment policy and wanton ways with other people's money. They have proven to be incapable of investing money and shouldn't be protected, while at the same time giving these wasters o f wealth our governments backing for more of the same. We need a system that benefits local communities by institutions that have maintained local ties and knowledge of how to do business from Fairbanks, AK to Tallahassee, FL. and from every between at least at the state level, but more appropriately at the county level. We need to stop the preference for large multinational corporations that donate millions to politicians and flee with profits to offshore tax havens. Rather big government should shift focus towards small sound local institutions, which only have political sway at the local level because they answer to their clients locally at church, community picnics, and in their communities where they live. That is real American accountability and that I think most Americans have faith in!<br /><br />Across the country there are many small banks that have not fallen into the trap of making bad loans and these small financially sound local institutions could manage a government program of a portfolio of bad local loans for sound local banks; rather than a "Bad Bank" as proposed in the Swedish model.</div><br />	jnaatus	-21	4	25	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2494-4049	
2496-4049	Get rid of Presidential Signing Statements as line-item vetoes	2009-05-20 00:00:00	The Executive Branch needs to accept that they operate under the laws passed by Congress, and stop using signing statements to negate part of these laws. If part of a law is unconstitutional, it should be reviewed by the Judiciary. The Executive has the responsibility to faithfully execute the laws passed by the popular body, and is not above such limitations on power.

2497-4049	Have the NTIS (National Technical Information Service) digitize all research reports	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Have the NTIS (National Technical Information Service) digitize all research reports, and make them available for FREE via the web. Currently NTIS charges prohibitive amounts for even the smallest reports, even in already-digitized format. NTIS also offers access to its database through private companies, i.e. paid services. All of the NTIS-stored reports were already paid for by the taxpayer and should be available electronically at no cost to the public. This service should NOT be available through a contractor service or any organization that provides "value added", i.e. the reports should be available from an NTIS server without going through any intermediaries which may want payment.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The availability of technical reports to the public is now hampered by the high costs.

2499-4049	Coordinating federal, state and local communicatioins 	2009-05-20 00:00:00	TV and websites are expensive; people don't consider if a TV show is broadcast locally or if a website is hosted nearby either because they aren't localized. Radio is more local and so are newspapers. Most local are posters, meetings, and other small-cast media. Right now, national, state and local public health groups are all making media without checking in with what each other are doing. And the expenses for all these kinds of media are repeated as different groups make their own campaigns.<br /><br />Funding for health communications should be designed to encourage federal agencies make or design the broadest and most expensive. They should coordinate with the state, county and city government to support them for more localized methods. Why should a city make a TV ad at $10,000 if the state of Kansas already has one, or Portland has a print campaign that could be adapted or the city could jump in on a national campaign and produce the less expensive localized media to support it?<br /><br />The upshot is that we need a library where public health designs and ideas are stored and everyone funded with government money for an ad campaign has to check the existing materials. Not that they are forced to use them, but at least document that they did not re-invent the wheel for lack of checking what is already out there. If some group is using government money they have to store it on the library.<br /><br />CDC Tobacco Control has such a system. Pan American Health Organization has developed a template for health promotion campaigns but hasn't launched it. We should do it for all health media - domestic or international.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Because there is a lot of great health education materials out there - those same materials could be used by other groups. I have seen great stuff shown once in a small area and across the country another group is struggling for an idea. They could have localized the existing one or if they had known they could have jumped in on a larger campaign. <br /><br /><br /><br />We don't have the luxury to make our own materials if we can use exisiting ones.</div><br />	betsy	8	16	8	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2499-4049	
2500-4049	Illegal Immigrants and Service Learning 	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Illegal Immigrants should be given legal status with a potential for a road to citizenship, but part of the participation in becoming a United States citizen should incorporate a service learning component to the path for becoming a United States citizen (rather than fines). Service Learning at the municipal, state level, and possibly federal level could help potential citizens learn about how government works and eventually become active participants in our society. Fines in no way have proven to be advantageous to creating better citizens. <br />1. Illegal immigrants would have to complete a certain amount (bank time) of community service working in the communities where they live. <br />2.

2501-4049	Add Web2.0-style Account Management Features for IRS Web site	2009-05-20 00:00:00	The process of filing tax returns, dealing with the Internal Revenue Service, and making sure that the right amount of tax has been paid is an enormous challenge that all Americans go through each year. Currently the tax administration process works like this: taxpayers receive documents about the income and deductions, they use these documents to fill out various tax forms, and submit the forms to the IRS. The IRS compiles these forms, and then cross-checks them against the same documents filled directly with the IRS from third-parties. Any discrepancies can result in an audit. <br /><br />This entire tax reporting process can be vastly simplified. Data about income and certain deductions are already reported to the I.R.S. The agency could make this data available to taxpayers through a sort of "My I.R.S. account". The data is required to be submitted to the I.R.S. in XML format, so the data is already well-formed. This data could made available to be downloaded into a tax software program, or used to pre-populate the required tax forms. Even better, the entire process could be handled on the I.R.S. Web site, whereby missing information is flagged so the taxpayer will know what additional information needs to be found and added so that their tax returns will be complete.<br /><br />Making the data flow from the IRS to the taxpayer will unleash all sorts of efficiencies in the administration of our tax laws. First, the taxpayer would be presented with a complete set of data that the IRS already knows about, thereby eliminating the possibility that the taxpayer might inadvertently overlook a document or two. Second, having Web-based account management would enable taxpayers to make correction (amendments) to specific information, and could interact with the IRS about account-specific issues such as setting up payment plans or asking for additional time. Audits would then become much more intelligent, as the IRS would not have to waste time verifying routine mismatches.<br /><br />Web-enabled filing and account management would have enormous implications for privacy, the possibility of hacking, and accessibility issues for Americans who aren't comfortable with or have access to technology. This technology however could be deployed through existing networks of tax professionals and publicly funded tax clinics.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The cost of complying with the tax laws, including filing out forms and hiring professional help, was roughly $244 billion in 2004 according to research conducted by the Tax Foundation. By comparison, President Obama hopes to raise taxes by $61 billion over the next ten years through the proposals outlined in his budget. If America can reduce the cost of complying with the tax laws, we can use that cost savings in more economically productive pursuits.</div><br />	taxes.guide	29	37	8	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2501-4049	
2502-4049	Save Money - Require government to use Open Source Software whenever possible	2009-05-20 00:00:00	The government is a huge customer for closed source proprietary software which incurs an unnecessary expense to taxpayers in software licensing fees. The general philosophy of open source software is that "more heads are better than one" when it comes to developing a logical solution to problem-solving. This philosophy compliments the role of our government which goes something like "for the people by the people"<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Using open source software in government and even encouraging its use in schools will save tons of money and will also avoid potential corporate influence on the governmental infrastructure. For example if separate government offices wanted to integrate their systems it could be done without being at the mercy of a huge corporate vendor's prerogative in opening their proprietary formats. </div><br />	crizgo	48	67	19	9	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2502-4049	
2503-4049	Revamp USAjobs.gov	2009-05-20 00:00:00	As someone who has been seeking federal employment for over 2 years, my experience with USAjobs.gov has never been good. It is a black hole. Everyone I know who has submitted a resume has never seen results either. One person inside the federal government explained it to me as "if there is a posting on the website, it is just a formality, and they already have their candidate from within." The listing is "required" but never taken seriously. This is very disheartening, especially for someone aspiring to civil service. The solution is perhaps more of a culture change rather than a technological change. I know everyone is on a budget or hiring freeze occasionally, but promotions should be based on merit and expertise instead of pay grade. Bringing in newcomers to the government should not be seen as a risk, especially when they may be more willing to innovate than entrenched officials.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The federal government needs to be able to recruit and retain the best talent. USAjobs.gov is failing as a tool for recruitment. It is easy to use, but never produces results.</div><br />	kirsten.mcneil	81	90	9	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2503-4049	
2506-4049	STOP hiding behind national security	2009-05-20 00:00:00	There is no open government without a clear directive from the executive (backed by congress) in support of a free and open internet and the prosecution of officials that have hidden their criminal activity behind the veil of national security. <br /><br />1. There is no amount of government transparency that will erase years of torture, illegal wiretapping, warrantless surveillance, the suspension of habeus corpus, the targeting of certain ethnic groups as "terrorists", eavesdropping on Americans, and the monitoring of American's internet traffic by the NSA. The last 8 years have all but ruined the freedom our American soldiers have fought and died to protect. <br /><br />Action must be taken to prevent subsequent administrations from trampling on the rights of Americans as they have for the last 8 years. Legislation must be passed to prevent the executive branch from protecting their "boys" and refusing to release information about state-sponsored crime in the interest of national security. <br /><br />2. In the internet age, there is really NOTHING that a state can do that hasn't been imagined and planned for in any number of online subversive forums, readily open to anyone with the ability to google. Information, in and of itself, does not lead terrorists to commit their atrocities, nor does secrecy prevent these atrocities in the absence of an imminent threat. <br /><br />I doubt that the release of the ACTA treaty, which the Obama administration recently refused to release as a state secret, would have given rise to an "imminent threat" of attack against Americans. The treaty does, however, pose an imminent threat to Corporate Media Conglomerates and their profits, who also happen to have a seat at the negotiating table. In the meantime, the American people, having been left out of the conversation, can barely tell you what ACTA is, let alone that widespread censorship, mandatory internet filtering, and the confiscation of digital content are all ideas on the table during these negotiations.<br /><br />Hiding behind the state secrets argument is not a method of maintaining our security, it is a method of maintaining CONTROL. Information is Power... 20 and more years ago, it was the power of spies to collect and analyze information about enemy states, as our enemies gathered intel on us. The revolution of the internet has taken any conceivable idea, no matter how benign or horrendous, and placed it squarely at our fingertips and those of our enemies. <br /><br />The power of information in the 21st century is a power that belongs to the PEOPLE. Let US know what's going on in our government and we'll fight the war on terror for you. Let US know what treaties are in negotiation and we'll tell you how we feel about it. Keep OUR internet free and open so that our enemies that practice censorship will be at a disadvantage, and not the other way around. We have an awesome opportunity to reinvent freedom for the 21st century with America continuing as the champion of liberty around the globe. Don't even bother wasting that opportunity on half measures that maintain the appearance of freedom. The information age has arrived, and we will know better. <br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>without it, we've fallen</div><br />	tessrossi	34	54	20	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2506-4049	
2507-4049	Make the US Patent & Trademark Office More Accountable	2009-05-20 00:00:00	I'm writing in my personal capacity as a citizen and not as a patent examiner. I believe that the USPTO should be made more accountable. I believe that the USPTO unfairly and illegally denies FOIA requests for information that it does have, or charges exorbitant and unwarranted fees in order to block the disclosure of information that it has that would shed light on much of its patent operations and personnel actions which are inefficient and corrupted. This is not fair or right. For example, the USPTO has in the past released information under FOIA on performance appraisal ratings for a particular year - and then when this information has been requested under FOIA several years later, the USPTO has refused to release this data stating, that it does not have the information. The USPTO has also released emails requested by an employee about him/herself free of charge under FOIA. When asked for this information several years later, the USPTO is charging fees of $3000 or more. These unethical and unwarrented FOIA practices inhibit transparency and the shedding of light on USPTO operations which ends up hurting inventors and workers. The USPTO also refused to release hundreds of pages on its controversial second pair of eyes program as requested under FOIA. The practice of the USPTO adopting bogus pretenses to refuse the release of information requested under FOIA - or to obstruct the release of information requested under FOIA by charging the requesters unwarranted and unjustified "search fees" needs to be investigated, and stopped.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>These unethical and unwarrented FOIA practices inhibit transparency and the shedding of light on USPTO operations which ends up hurting inventors and workers.

2509-4049	Don't Even Begin to Think About About Expanding FOIA Without . . .	2009-05-20 00:00:00	• Thoroughly understanding the real world, end-to-end mechanics and costs of satisfying a FOIA request.<br />• Thoroughly understanding the tax that vigorous FOIA compliance would put on program employees and other non-disclosure personnel<br />• Reshaping FOIA operations in most agencies in light of that understanding<br />• Increasing staffing (and not just disclosure specialists) or changing the sunshine laws to address what cannot be resolved by better staffing and BPR<br />• NOT RUSHING your consideration of the above, taking testimony of the people who never give testimony, surveying the Federal community, and taking a business process view of the sunshine laws from the perspective of all stakeholders (not just FOIA offices, requesters, and their attorneys)<br /><br />A problem statement follows:<br /><br />In reality, FOIA requests are processed not by FOIA officers or records managers, but, rather, by the busy and dwindling ranks of program personnel and other Federal employees with no particular expertise or interest in disclosure matters. These employees are persistently asked to put aside pressing program matters to conduct time-consuming records searches, often to satisfy broad and ill-defined requests of an equally busy coterie of public interest groups masquerading as journalists. It's like running a business in a constant state of litigation, where the discovery period never ends, and where you are always the defendant holding all relevant documents. One need not have a problem with the philosophy behind the FOIA to concede that, if we are going to have it, Congress must consider the actual mechanics and costs of its satisfaction. Recent legislation, such as the Open Government Act of 2007, showed no sign that such consideration occurred.<br /><br />The issues and documents of most interest to FOIA requesters often concern policy or program activities involving senior staff or derive from the efforts of groups of Federal employees and contractor employees. Let me illustrate. Imagine being a GS-15 program analyst and having worked on a large scale project over a two-year period. The project has interagency dimensions and involves weekly interagency meetings, recommendations, drafts and redrafts, several e-mails a week, and scattered notes. Imagine that your life is filled with such projects and that you already don't have enough time to complete the assignments dumped in your in-box. As well, the prospect of significantly better staffing to alleviate this crush is, by now, laughable for anybody who has watched the slow bleeding of the Federal workforce since 1995. Now imagine a FOIA request, coming under cover of a form from your FOIA officer, asking for all records pertaining to some issue that runs through the project like a kite in heavy crosswinds. Even with a well run records management system and the best search tools (neither of which you probably have), a competent search could take days. Instead, you have to make a choice: do a breezy and inept search that takes an hour or two and saves some of your work day for what your boss needs to get done, delay until you can scrounge for more time, read the request hyper-technically, or lie. Negotiation with the requester might help, but that process will cost more time and still likely leave you holding a big bag.<br /><br />Let's assume that you find the time to conduct a search that passes the blue face test, and it produces half a ream of paper. You would then have the joy of following the next line in the FOIA processing instruction, which is to identify (line by line) the exemptions that could or should be claimed pertaining to the material. The exemptions are tricky, and the number of off-Act statutory exemptions (and disclosure prohibitions) are growing. Add even more hours of lost time. Oh, incidentally, adequate office clerical support has also collapsed, but we couldn't trust them to suggest exemption claims (or even collect documents requiring interpretation) anyways. <br />In a nutshell, that's what is happening on the ground level. <br /><br />There is nothing in recent legislation designed to adequately deal with those realities. There are, however, personnel actions suggested for Federal employees who must choose between meeting statutory program dates and statutory FOIA dates. The FOIA boosters also tend to overlook the fact that the FOIA requesters have become more invasive and tactical over the years -- at the same time Government information has grown like a mushroom cloud rising from new technologies that spawn a chain reaction of new records and new records series. This proliferation of "records" is now demanded free of charge by anybody with a copy of Dreamweaver or MS Expressions, as a "journalist." This notion of journalist would hardly have been respected by the Congress that created the FOIA or even the Congresses that enacted the later significant amendments to the Act. Whatever fee they are charging to the few remaining requesters who are not journalists, it can't begin to cover the true costs of the more highly paid Government employees spending hours of time hunting down documents and doing line-by-lines to satisfy the requesters (never mind lost opportunity costs). <br /> <br />There aren't enough Federal employees to do the program work that is being required anymore. The administrative offices of Federal agencies (including FOIA, records management offices, and information resources management offices) have been devastated by streamlining and rightsizing initiatives. Moreover, what remains of program offices are being eaten alive by what those administrative offices used to do (or at least make easier for the program offices). That's just a fact. All the public policy grandstanding in the world won't change it. <br /><br />Let's have a real world dialogue in this Nation about the costs of Government, what we want to spend our money on, what we can and can't afford, and what is feasible or not. Transparency sounds great. If it is conceived in the same fashion as recent FOIA-related legislation, however, it will crash and burn in practice. It will crash and burn for want of Federal time and personnel and due to the ascendancy of a growing and pampered public interest segment demanding a dwindling piece of the public sector, as if nothing has changed, and as if the only documents retained lay in well-stored paper file folders, organized by subjects of the requester's peculiar choosing. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea is important because our legislators don't have a clue about how FOIA functions in the real world and are more concerned with good government grandstanding than actually crafting and staffing a practical and workable disclosure program that takes into consideration the business needs AND CAPACITY of Executive agencies.</div><br />	finserra	-10	13	23	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2509-4049	
2510-4049	Ask Federal Agencies to Adopt the Core Principles for Public Engagement	2009-05-20 00:00:00	Over the past several months, experts in public dialogue, facilitation and collaborative decision-making worked together to develop 7 "Core Principles for Public Engagement." The authors and editors of these principles have spent years creating and honing innovative techniques that help people talk constructively about difficult issues that effect their lives--issues like health care, crime, and conflict between ethnic groups. <br /><br />We consider these 7 principles to be the fundamental components of quality public engagement, and we propose that federal agencies adopt these principles to guide their public engagement work. <br /><br />Engaging people around the issues that affect their lives and their country is a key component of a strong democratic society. Effective public engagement goes beyond public relations and information-sharing by providing ways for people with a variety of viewpoints to grapple with issues together and come up with creative solutions. <br /><br />- The Core Principles for Public Engagement -<br /><br />These seven recommendations reflect the common beliefs and understandings of those working in the fields of public engagement, conflict resolution, and collaboration. In practice, people apply these and additional principles in many different ways.<br /><br />1. Careful Planning and Preparation<br />Through adequate and inclusive planning, ensure that the design, organization, and convening of the process serve both a clearly defined purpose and the needs of the participants.<br /><br />2. Inclusion and Demographic Diversity<br />Equitably incorporate diverse people, voices, ideas, and information to lay the groundwork for quality outcomes and democratic legitimacy.<br /><br />3. Collaboration and Shared Purpose<br />Support and encourage participants, government and community institutions, and others to work together to advance the common good.<br /><br />4. Openness and Learning<br />Help all involved listen to each other, explore new ideas unconstrained by predetermined outcomes, learn and apply information in ways that generate new options, and rigorously evaluate public engagement activities for effectiveness.<br /><br />5. Transparency and Trust<br />Be clear and open about the process, and provide a public record of the organizers, sponsors, outcomes, and range of views and ideas expressed.<br /><br />6. Impact and Action<br />Ensure each participatory effort has real potential to make a difference, and that participants are aware of that potential.<br /><br />7. Sustained Engagement and Participatory Culture<br />Promote a culture of participation with programs and institutions that support ongoing quality public engagement.<br /><br />-<br /><br />More details about each of these principles, info about who took part in creating them and how, and a growing list of endorsements can all be found at www.thataway.org/pep .

I believe that the USPTO should be prevented from destroying crucial records which would shed light on its patent operations, especially when these records may be crucial to pending lawsuits that inventors, or workers may have.

This director has since been promoted to have a key role in overseeing the patents division. With this kind of obfuscation of records and facts, corrupt policies and managerial practices that hurt both the inventors, waste tax payers dollars, and hurt workers will be hidden. Something needs to be done. There needs to be a records retention policy that will prevent the destruction of crucial records which shed light on patent operations such as these. The public should be able to ensure that patent operations are being administered in a fair, uncorrupted, and unbiased manner. Inventors would be interested in the administration of for example, the 2nd pair of eyes review program, because this program resulted in many internal delays of their patent applications being issued into patents. Some Examiners are of the opinion that the 2nd pair of eyes review program was used in a political fashion rather than for a legitimate end- which ended up harming inventors. the USPTO should be made to post on its website for the public, key emails between managers and other staff such as secretaries, and legal instruments examiners pertaining to the administration of the 2nd pair of eyes program. Of course privacy should be respected when the privacy of patent examiners' may be violated.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>There needs to be a records retention policy that will prevent the destruction of crucial records which shed light on patent operations .

Switch this premise around by adding a legal category that says, "public but online dissemination not required. If it is not limited by the law, then put it online for all by default. Period. This would not change access to legally protected/national security information.<br /><br />Piecemeal legislation to require proactive disclosure of spending information is only a first step. <br /><br />While over exposure of legally public information about individuals should be constrained (there is some value in not having everything in Google even if people can legally request access), government needs to work differently than our natural tendency to keep information close to the chest.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>If Estonia can do this, why can't we?

Making a general holiday on voting day would allow for greater participation of the workers of the United States of America in the American voting system.

2525-4049	Make US Patent & Trademark Office's Use of Taxpayers' dollars transparent	2009-05-21 00:00:00	I'm writing in my personal capacity and not in my capacity as a patent examiner, although I'm employed as such at the USPTO.<br /><br />The USPTO is granted alot of money from Congress but uses it irresponsibly. Right now, the USPTO's top managers are claiming that a funding crisis exists and that the USPTO is low on funds because of the recession. However, the truth of the matter is that much of the scarcity of funds was created by the USPTO's own inefficient and self destructive managerial policies which suppressed allowance rates artificially through a politicized "Quality review" process which was not wholeheartedly used as a tool to ensure quality uniformly, but was used as tool of bias, favoritism and cronyism and as a witch hunt against certain patent examiners on basises having little to do with merit. Examiners who were liked for other considerations having nonething to do with merit were left unscathed by the 2nd pair of eyes program, whereas other examiners who became disliked by management for considerations having nothing to do with "merit" - were targetted by this program. As a result, many patent applications that had been allowed, were held up - in some cases -were left to languish for years on end - after having been reviewed under the 2nd pair of eyes program. The USPTO's "Witchhunt" has suppressed allowances and deprived it of fees and produced a funding scarcity. The USPTO has reduced overtime pay for patent examiners and cut a whole host of other programs using the justification that it needs to save monies because of the recession and a scarcity of funds.<br /><br />Meanwhile, key managers and the Office of General Counsel are currently plotting to misuse taxpayers funds to attempt to defend corrupt managerial practices, and to maintain a highly stratified work environment that to a great extent is not meritocratic.<br /><br />The USPTO needs to be more transparent in how it spends it monies. It should be made to post information on how much its Office of General Counsel spends on employee relations actions - and in litigating lawsuits against employees, and on settlements involving employees - to the extent this information can be revealed without breaching privacy. The USPTO should release data to the public on how much fees it has lost as a result of its second pair of eyes program and suppressing allowances through its biased and ineffective "quality review" program.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The public needs to see whether or not in this time of recession and need, the USPTO's Office of General Counsel and Deciding Officials are wasting tax payers' dollars defending corrupt, and unmeritocratic managerial practices.</div><br />	Patent Examiner	17	25	8	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2525-4049

But the nuts and bolts of democracy are systems that protect ballot integrity, that allow ballot access, that allow 3rd parties to participate in presidential debates, that provide campaign funding transparency and some form of public campaign financing, that allow early voting, voting by mail, same day registration, instant runoff voting etc., all the way to issues such as the re-enfranchisement of felons who have done their time and are trying ro reassimilate into society, and making Voter Tuesday a national holiday.

2535-4049	A national citizens' assembly to represent the people's wisdom	2009-05-21 00:00:00	A citizen's assembly (CA) is a randomly selected body of several hundred people, brought together to serve a single term on a single issue and then disbanded. The CA has three phases:<br /><br />1. Intensive information gathering: participants get up to speed on the issue and have the opportunity to hear from a wide variety of witnesses who have relevant information.<br /><br />2. Dialogue and deliberation: participants build trust first and only then enter into a process of deliberation over the specific question(s) they are charged with.<br /><br />3. Vote: the CA is not required to be unanimous, but it may be considered void if it does not result in a strong majority in agreement.<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />We know how to create the conditions for good public participation:<br /><br />1. Get everyone in the room. (No, not 300 million of us -- a representative sample will do, best of all if it is randomly selected, with required attendance, as juries are.)<br /><br />2. Provide access to the best available information, including a range of experts, and allow participants to ask questions.<br /><br />3. Create the conditions for honest, productive discussion and have a facilitator to help the process. Let people share their stories and values first, before digging into differences and debates.<br /><br />4. Empower the group so that the outcome of their work actually matters.<br /><br />These four principles have emerged from thousands of experiments in innovative forms of participatory democracy, ranging from small citizen's juries to large deliberative polls, from year-long citizen's assemblies to electronically-enhanced town meetings that take a day or a weekend.<br /><br />When these conditions are satisfied, what we find is that:<br /><br />1. People are willing and able to do it -- they defy "expert" predictions about how the subject matter is "too complex" or the amount of background information too large.<br /><br />2. People generally like it -- in fact, they find it deeply fulfilling.<br /><br />3. The product is generally excellent.<br /><br />Any process that embodies these principles is likely to be a huge improvement on the status quo.

Many larger corporations support an internal help desk accessible by web, telephone or chat. Each new incident is tracked and followed proactively until resolved or closed. An existing off the shelf system (best of breed) should be adapted to track all contacts with Social Security and Medicare, especially mailed documents and forms. Calling Social Security about a problem should not result in someone saying, that there is no information available about matters or documents being processed at a local office. Every contact and document should be tracked and assigned to a new or open case. It should not be necessary to use the constituant services of a US Congress member or Senator to resolve routine paperwork stuck somewhere in the cumbersome and disjointed Social Security and Medicare system.

2537-4049	Incentivizing Sustainability Through a Tax Code Based on Consumption	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Our tax system is screwed up. We're taxed for owning a house; we're taxed for owning land; we're taxed for having a job; we're taxed for pretty much existing. While it's true that taxes are necessary for a government to function, they don't have to be this numerous and/or complicated. There are thousands of pages of tax codes in Washington that are way too complicated for the average American to understand. Corrupt businesses and individuals can find loopholes and disclaimers to give themselves immunity from certain taxes and sometimes avoid paying millions of dollars that should have been paid. Most people agree that this is a slap in the face to "equality" and agree that the tax codes need to be simplified.<br /><br />Not being satisfied with any of the currently proposed systems, I came up with a detailed outline (it was going to be a long article, but I stopped after the outline stage haha) of how I think businesses and taxes should be handled in this country. My tax system is a tax system based on reducing consumption and incentivizing post-consumer products along with sustainable practices. It's a fact that taxes are generally viewed by the public as bad things, so wouldn't it make sense to tax bad things instead of good things like income? The fact is that we can't go on consuming, consuming, consuming because we live on a finite planet. Eventually, we will run out of earth to consume. If we penalize the use of natural resources and incentivize sustainability, we will do the earth a very big favour. The following is a rough outline of my idea of the perfect 21st century tax code.<br /><br />General rules for all entities:<br /><br />1. Energy consumed is taxed. It is seen as buying a product from an energy-producing company.<br />-Energy producing companies still need energy and also generally use natural resources to create energy, so they will be taxed.<br />-Companies which produce energy by alternative methods (wind, solar, etc.) will be taxed on consuming the materials to make the turbines, panels, etc., but not for the energy they produce using these methods because it's not consuming natural resources.<br /><br />2. Salaries for workers will not be taxed because "people are not a resource." You can't buy time/labour.<br />-Taxing money given to workers will cause the company to give out less to workers, lowering salaries, and hurting the workers.<br /><br />3. Sales will not be taxed from the vendor-point; only from the consumer-point. Taxing both would be double taxing.<br />-Companies will charge a certain amount for a product. Then tax will be paid directly to the government so companies can't interfere.<br /><br />4. Donations to charities will not be taxed.<br />-A person is "giving" to the charity, not "consuming" the charity.<br />-This may cause problems with the definitions of "donation" and "consumption." Tax cheats could possibly claim they were donating to a charity when they aren't.<br />-Would have to be enforced by a government organization.<br /><br />5. Buying waste products will not be taxed.<br />-All companies have goals (i.e. "This company will make plastic bottles"). Any product/good that can be used to meet that goal can not be claimed as waste.<br />-By-products or non-necessary materials that can in no way contribute to the goal of the companies is "waste."<br />-Companies cannot declare a goal to make waste.<br /><br />6. No property is taxed except property dedicated to a landfill.<br />-A company can either sell its trash, reduce the amount of trash created, or buy a landfill (they can't just let it pile up).<br />--Since greenhouse gas emissions are also "waste," companies will be taxed on those.<br />--Since selling its trash increases revenue instead of cost, selling will be incentivized.<br />-Goods that can't be recycled or reused will always end up in a landfill.<br />--This will cause the company that buys those goods to lose money for owning a landfill, so no company will buy it.<br />--This discourages non-recycleable production.<br /><br />7. There are no other taxes!<br />-Individuals do not pay social security, medicare, etc. The funds come directly from tax dollars produced from consumption.<br /><br /><br /><br />Base companies (extract natural resources from the earth)<br /><br />1. Company expenses are mainly composed of energy costs and buying equipment from other companies. These costs are taxed.<br />-The only way a company will be profitable is if the value of the extracted goods is greater than the cost of energy.<br /><br />2. They will not have to pay a tax on basic consumption because they will simply be taking materials from the ground<br />-This seems to give an incentive to natural resource depletion, but companies that buy goods from base companies have to pay tax. Companies that buy post-disposal goods don't.<br />-Other companies will therefore be less likely to buy from these companies because it will cost more.<br /><br /><br /><br />1st tier companies (buy resources directly from base companies)<br /><br />1. Company expenses consist of business transactions wherein goods are bought from base companies and other companies. These will be taxed.<br /><br />2. Company will use energy and purchases to convert raw goods into new products, which are then sold.<br />-Buyers will primarily include other companies.<br /><br /><br /><br />High-tier (consumer) companies (buy resources primarily from 1st tier companies)<br /><br />1. Taxed on purchases from other companies.<br /><br />2. Will use energy and purchases to combine goods into bigger "super"-goods, which will eventually be sold straight to consumers - no other companies.<br /><br />3. Retail stores, department stores, clothing, etc.<br /><br /><br /><br />General population/Consumers (don't sell anything; buy only)<br /><br />1. Receive money from work done for companies.<br /><br />2. Won't produce/sell anything, and all purchases are consumption, so all money is taxed (except savings and donations)<br /><br />3. Buy goods for use then discard them.<br /><br /><br /><br />Post-disposal companies (buy waste products to sell them again)<br /><br />1. Buy waste from consumers/commpanies to make new products from them. Since these goods are "waste," their purchase will not be taxed.<br /><br />2. Only taxes paid by these companies is energy/equipment.<br />-A post-disposal company that produces its energy from renewable sources and buys post-disposal equipment will thus pay no taxes.<br />-Incentivizes post-disposal companies and sustainable living.<br /><br />3. Company will turn waste into "new" products and sell them to consumers.<br />-Consumers will still be taxed for this consumption (because buying recycled stuff is still buying stuff).<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Our tax system is out of whack and needs to be simplified. Not only does this solve that problem, but it goes along with President Obama's green agenda.</div><br />	dudemanfellabra	31	42	11	5	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2537-4049	
2539-4049	Interagency Task Force for Information Technology Standards Development Reform 	2009-05-21 00:00:00	An Information Society's software infrastructure can be no better than the quality of its connectivity but the economy is awash with IT standards that lack specification of the conformity requirements essential to achieve interoperability. A holistic solution is desperately needed, one that does not focus on a single vendor, but rather on standards development organizations ("SDO's"). <br /><br />We have a global legal framework for that task in place, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. But U.S. implementation of the ATBT is deeply flawed, from bright-line constitutional defects in the enabling legislation, to a near-complete abdication of government ATBT responsibilities to the private sector, to an incredible lack of education of SDO's and their members as to their legal responsibilities. <br /><br />Therefore, I propose an interagency task force aimed at studying such issues and getting the message across to SDO's that they have a crucially important gatekeeper responsibility to ensure that IT standards exhibit the strategic common characteristics of interoperability, portability, and cultural and linguistic adaptability. <br /><br />Corrective action is also needed for the defective ATBT implementing legislation and the unconstitutional delegation of government ATBT responsibilities to the private sector without so much as notice and comment rulemaking. http://ts.nist.gov/Standards/Conformity/ansimou.cfm There are also related problems with the U.S. implementation of the Agreement on Government Procurement, which requires that government procurement specifications be based on international standards developed under the auspices of the ATBT. <br /><br />Because of overlapping subject matter legal jurisdiction and the need for coordinated action, the task force should (minimally) include representatives from eGov, the DoJ Antitrust Division, the FTC, State Dept., Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and NIST.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It standards that do not specify clearly and unambiguously the conformity requirements essential to achieve interoperability are impenetrable connectivity barriers to open eGovernment, forcing citizens to acquire single-vendor software solutions to connect with government. Such standards bestow unlawful competitive advantage upon the implementing vendor with the largest market share, whose implementation in reality defines what is a standard in name only. The dominant implementation's tail wags the standard dog.<br /><br />Just how broken the U.S. standards system is broken is dramatically illustrated by standards for word processor document formats. The word processor was invented in 1956. Yet 53 years later, we still have no open standard for word processor document formats that specifies the conformity requirements essential to achieve interoperability.<br /><br />Pushing a single vendor cannot undo such situations, which commonly arise because of stalemates among major vendors. It is an industry-wide problem and may only be effectively addressed as such. The right focal point is the responsible standard development organization that allows such anti-competitive standards to be developed and adopted. Delivering an effective message that information technology SDOs bear the legal responsibility for policing the relevant activities of their membership is the most efficient way for government to ensure pro-competitive IT standards. See e.g., Allied Tube & Conduit v. Indian Head, Inc. 486 U.S. 492 (1988), http://laws.findlaw.com/us/486/492.html ("private standard-setting associations have traditionally been objects of antitrust scrutiny").</div><br />	marbux	8	13	5	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2539-4049

2552-4049	Require all Federal Government meetings that are subject to the Open Meetings Laws to be Webcast online.	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Board meetings are where some of the most important decisions are made by our government. Allow the American people access to the decision making process by requiring all of these meetings to be webcast on the Internet both live and on-demand.<br /><br />The Governor of New York State pioneered this initiative in 2007 when he required all State agencies and authorities to webcast their meetings (Executive Order 3). It's been highly successful. The State requires all the agencies to webcast their meetings live if they have the Internet access to do it live and requires them to post the meetings online within 48 hours for on-demand viewing. The webcasts need to work for both broadband and dial-up users and be compatible with at least 2 media players. All videos are closed captioned within 7 days for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.<br /><br />Having these meetings online will save a ton of money for both the government and interested parties who normally have to travel to attend these meetings. By having these meetings webcast online, some people who would normally travel to the meetings will no longer have to -saving time, money, and energy. It's the green way to go.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This initiative or important because it opens up the decision making process at government board meetings to the public. By requiring all Federal agencies to webcast their board meetings, it holds government decision makers accountable for what they say. It also saves time, money and energy because it reduces the amount of travel to meetings by interested parties. Why would they travel to the meetings if they could just watch them online.</div><br />	mike	148	172	24	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2552-4049

It would provide a portal for citizens to review and comment on proposed legislation and track government accountability (such as donors to their representatives). However, institutionalization will help get members of government and their staff interacting with citizens.<br /><br />For example, on the government side there should be functionality that allows a representative to filter out all comments to find those posted by their constituents. They could also allow twitter or RSS to rapidly take surveys amongst constituents. Filters could also be used to find expert opinions by filtering out constituents to see what lobbyists or academics are saying about a bill. Combine these filtering options with data visualization tools will make it easy for representatives to tap into the public consciousness and citizens to have a dialogue with their government on issues of the day.<br /><br />Another filter would be to adjust the scale on which you are viewing. Be able to toggle between the district, state, and national discussions so you can find issues more relevant to your specific location. This could also be used to find local volunteer and public service opportunities. Furthermore, each opportunity could use a standard form to log hours of volunteers, so your citizen profile could show not only how active you are online but also how active you are in your community. This would be a great way to get credit for civic participation. <br /><br />There are many more ways this could be more efficient.

2558-4049	Civil rights	2009-05-21 00:00:00	<br /><br />A Civil Rights Agenda for a New Administration<br /><br />by Marc Brenman<br /><br /><br />Opportunity: A new Administration will take its place in Washington, DC in January 2009. It will be faced with many problems and opportunities. As the Nation confronts issues of the economy, the war in Iraq, and energy prices, social justice must not be forgotten. The nation is dependent on all its people for solutions and contributions. Discrimination is a drag on the economy; unemployed and underemployed people cannot make their full contribution and are more likely to call upon social welfare, benefits, and entitlement programs. Areas that are more diverse and inclusive are more likely to be economically vibrant. The United States is becoming more diverse. This diversity should be reframed as a benefit, and not a problem. To lower barriers to achieving the benefits of diversity, a group of civil rights law enforcers and advocates offers the following suggestions for ways a new Administration could use its political tools to enhance social justice for all. <br /><br />Full funding of Community Relations Service of Dept of Justice<br /><br /> The CRS has become a shell of its former self, while demands for community mediation from awful events like the Jena Six and hate crimes are on the rise. <br /><br />Civil Rights Enforcement:<br /><br />Cease efforts by the federal judiciary and Justice Department to eliminate the disparate impact method of proving discrimination. <br /><br />De-politicizing US Commission on Civil Rights: The USCCR has devolved into a mockery of what it was set up to achieve--the study and resolution of social justice issues in the United States.<br /><br />Passing and signing an Omnibus Civil Rights Act, which would include creating a private right of suit for people under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other federal statutes that depend upon receipt of federal financial assistance for jurisdiction.<br /><br />Full funding of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission: The EEOC is perennially underfunded, while complaints rise, due in part to declines in the economy.<br /><br /> Full funding of EEOC Fair Employment Practices Agencies budget, including moneys for employment testing (EEOC currently is not permitted to conduct testing due to Congressional requirements);<br /><br />De-politicizing Civil Rights Division of DOJ.<br /><br />Women's Rights:<br /><br />Enunciate the rights of women to obtain medical services from pharmacists.<br /><br />Passing and signing the Ledbetter Paycheck Fairness Act: The fight to achieve pay equity for women is not over.<br /><br />Anti-Terrorism Issues:<br /><br />Reform the Patriot Act: The Patriot Act included some reasonable security measures, but allowed significant violations of privacy without warrants or judicial oversight. Civil immigration law was used to target many without reason to believe any connection to terrorist activity. The right to a lawyer was withheld for some who should have been allowed representation and the confidentiality of the lawyer-client relationship breached. Overlooking the rule of law at a time that the world needs to see the strength of the American system weakens us, and the denial of civil rights has not made us more secure. Restore habeus corpus and rights of Americans not to be spied on. No secret subpoenas.<br />Immigration Issues:<br />Reform immigration enforcement law to accomplish the following:<br />Create due process protections, such as notification of immigration charges and access to counsel and phones, during immigration enforcement efforts;<br />Require DHS to implement regulations to ensure that immigration detainees are treated humanely;<br />Promote "alternatives to detention" programs that are more humane and cost-effective than traditional penal-style detention;<br />Establish an ICE ombudsman to investigate complaints and to create DHS accountability; and<br />Provide labor protections to ensure that ICE worksite raids do not undermine labor or employment law investigations.<br />Predatory Lending:<br /><br />Prevent predatory lending. Many people of color and other ordinary Americans have been adversely affected by unconscionable lending terms, and have lost their homes.<br /><br />Transportation:<br /><br />Reduce reliance on tolling roads and bridges because of its regressive economic efforts on low income people.<br /><br />Increase access to jobs, education, health care and other essential <br />opportunities by restoring federal operating funding for public transit operators that serve areas with high concentrations of transit dependent families, seniors, youth and persons with disabilities. Providing operating funding for improved bus service in <br />economically-depressed areas, using clean-air technologies, will combat climate change while spurring economic development throughout metropolitan regions.<br /><br />Education:<br /><br />Restore affirmative action in education. The numbers and percents of minorities in graduate and professional schools have dropped significantly since the end of affirmative action. <br /><br />Hate Crimes:<br />Strengthen federal hate crime law. Keep language that would extend protection for gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability. The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Act has passed both the House and Senate with a strong bipartisan majority. The hate crimes legislation is critical. Although Congress established a federal hate crime law in 1968, it only grants jurisdiction if the victim was participating in a "federally protected activity" like serving on a jury, attending public school, or voting. What's more, the law only covers crimes motivated by bias against people of a particular race, color, religion, or national origin. It excludes the 15.5 % of hate crimes based on sexual orientation and the untracked hate crimes based on gender, gender identity, and disability. The Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Act would fill these critical gaps in federal hate crime jurisdiction. <br />Diversity in Federal Service:<br /><br />Increase the representation of Hispanics in the federal service. Numerous reports have enunciated the problem. <br /><br />Extend health benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees, who are twice as likely to be uninsured as their heterosexual counterparts. Federal employees in same-sex partnerships currently have no access to benefits for their partners. Domestic partner benefits present an opportunity for the federal government to improve the quality of its workforce, and indicate its acceptance of all American families. Congress is currently considering the Domestic Partner Benefits and Obligations Act (H.R. 4838/S. 2521), which would extend these benefits, along with the other rights and responsibilities of married couples, to federal employees in same-sex domestic partnerships. <br />Services to Limited English Proficient People:<br />Provide adequate funding for English as a Second Language classes. Many adults want to learn English, but there is a shortage of classes.<br />Disability Issues:<br />Provide adequate funding for special education for children with disabilities. Congress have never provided the promised funds for schools. <br />Ensure strict enforcement of the Help America Vote Act's requirements that all polling sites and voting machines are fully accessible to persons with disabilities;<br /><br />Count Everyone:<br />Make sure the Census counts everyone, and eliminates undercounts for minorities, people with disabilities, and LGBT families.<br />Low-Income Issues:<br />Action is needed to bolster the resources available to the nation's primary federal programs targeting the home energy needs of low-income households--the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program , or LIHEAP, and the Weatherization Assistance Program, or WAP.<br />Expand the use of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Over the last 30 years, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has grown into the largest Federal anti-poverty program in the United States. In 2006, 22.4 million tax filers received $43.4 billion in tax credits through the program, with the average recipient receiving more than $1,900. At $4 per gallon, an average EITC check can pay for approximately 32 tanks of gas. However, 7.5 million families eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit failed to take advantage of the program, costing themselves a total of $14.5 billion in tax benefits.<br />Criminal Justice:<br />Move the criminal justice system toward second chances, job training, and rehabilitation for ex-prisoners and those about to be released. End the disparity between sentencing for crack and powder cocaine. End use of the death penalty until the disparities between African-Americans and Anglos are resolved. With the highest incarceration rate in the world, the United States releases more than 650,000 individuals from prison and another 9 million from jails each year. Most are low-income minority men, and most return to areas of concentrated poverty. Within only three years, nearly half are expected to return to prison--in part due to a lack of social supports for reintegrating into society. Many of the nearly 2.3 million incarcerated individuals today will return to their neighborhoods with significant barriers to successful reentry and reintegration. Over half are functionally illiterate or read below a fourth grade level, many suffer from mental illness, and up to 25% have serious health problems like Hepatitis C, tuberculosis and AIDS. After serving their time, former prisoners are entitled to the opportunity to be valuable contributors to the nation and to the economy in the face of these clearly tough hurdles.<br />Bring back the COPS (Community Oriented Policing) program -- a Clinton administration initiative that looked to cut the crime rate by offering grants to communities to hire more police officers and have them work in the community. <br />Fair Housing:<br />Take more efforts to end residential segregation. Research shows that residential segregation, both de facto and de jure, is the most detrimental to the health of racial and ethnic minorities. High levels of residential segregation result in a large percentage of minority children living in neighborhoods characterized by concentrated poverty. According to a Health Affairs article, on average, about 76% of black children and 69% of Latino children (poor and non-poor) in large metropolitan areas live in neighborhoods with poverty rates higher than those found in the neighborhoods of the worst-off white children.<br />Add source of income as a protected class in federal fair housing laws. Many people on voucher and other social benefit programs are turned away by landlords. Landlords can currently turn away single parents, often women, who rely on child support as a source of income.<br />Enhance the enforcement powers of the Fair Housing Act, and state and local laws that are substantially equivalent, to investigate and prosecute discriminatory advertising posted on-line by Internet service providers and companies that provide electronic community forums (such as Craigslist);<br /><br />Media Access:<br />Support efforts for diverse ownership of media outlets. Media outlet consolidation has left many markets with no voice for minorities.<br />Healthcare:<br />Reduce the use of federal pre-emption that prevents states from requiring large companies to provide health benefits, and prevents many financial institutions from being regulated by states.<br />HIV/AIDS:<br />Reform the American insurance industry so people who are HIV positive can buy life insurance. Right now, people who are HIV positive and are undergoing the current medical standard of care are living a long time, but cannot buy life insurance. <br />Education:<br />Shift higher education funding back to more grants and fewer loans, so that more minority students can afford to go to college. Many minority students cannot afford the loans. <br />Farmworkers:<br />Alleviate the shortage of farmworker housing. People who grow our high quality food for reasonable prices deserve to have roofs over their heads, running water, cooking facilities, and indoor sanitation facilities. <br />Native Americans:<br />Resolve the long-running lawsuit against the Interior Department regarding lack of accountability over trust funds for Native Americans, in favor of providing Native Americans their funds plus an accounting. <br />LGBT Issues:<br /><br />Repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, which serves as the major barrier for federal recognition of equality for GLBT members who are in committed relationships;<br /><br />Repeal the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy so as to ensure equal opportunity in the US military; replace the policy with full access of the military to LGBT people, so that all can serve their country in the military if they so wish. If the nation is under attack, it needs the services of all its people to protect it. <br /><br />Repeal the Food and Drug Administration regulations that prohibit blood donations from any gay man in the US, at a time when all blood is tested and there is a tremendous need for blood (not to mention, it is outright discriminatory, because they do not refuse to let women who have had relations with gay men from donating);<br /><br />Make the Fair Housing Act truly equal by adding additional protected groups to FHA, on basis of "sexual orientation", and "gender identity or expression";<br /><br />Eliminate the granting of any public tax payer dollars to entities that discriminate, including on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, or disability (this means a major overhaul of the Faith Based Initiatives program);<br /><br />Passing and signing ENDA (employment rights for LGBT people, including transgender). Many states now protect the rights of LGBT people to fully participate in American life, with employment, public accommodations, and housing protections. It is time for the federal government and the nation to follow suit.<br /><br />Ensure that LGBT people facing persecution in their home countries can seek asylum in the U.S.; allow the immigrant partners of LGBT US citizens to remain in the US as married couples are allowed to do.<br /><br />Voting:<br /><br />Eliminate ID laws for on-site voting; they have disproportionately negative effects on the elderly and minorities. <br /><br />Create universal voter registration (national voter registration so that one's voting rights are transportable) and enhance the Motor Voter law; ensure that as many voting places are available in minority neighborhoods as in others.<br /><br />Environmental Justice:<br /><br />Enact an Environmental Justice statute, so that the concept at the federal level is not dependent on an executive order.<br /><br /><br />[Version of 11/12/08]<br /><br />For further information:<br /><br />Marc Brenman<br />2541 Capitol Blvd. S.<br />Olympia, WA 98501<br /><br />mbrenman001@comcast.net<br />240-676-2436<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Social justice should be an important priority for the Administration. </div><br />	mbrenman001	2	19	17	5	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2558-4049

2562-4049	Make holding public office entail a sacrifice of certain rights.	2009-05-21 00:00:00	In shaping our nation, public office holders are given the power and privilege that that task requires. However, this power can be abused. The risk should be minimized by making it a requirement of such offices that the office holders voluntarily sacrifice certain rights. The obvious example would be the right to privacy: if someone is given the power to create laws, to implement policy, that person should not be able to hide how those laws affect his or her personal situation.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Our government is a representational democracy. If such a government is to be open, the very lives of the representative must be open to the scrutiny of the public. Representatives are given privileges beyond those of the average citizen, and they should thus be subject to oversight that the average citizen is protected against.</div><br />	michaeljcorliss	-16	16	32	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2562-4049	
2563-4049	Transform Federal Depository Libraries into regional data centers	2009-05-21 00:00:00	If we're aiming for full transparency there's going to be a lot of data. And accompanying will be high-demand for book/document scanning, content management (tagging/annotation, normalizing data), and an overall scope that includes federal agencies scattered across the country. To help build a quick infrastructure to handle this work why not modernize the existing Federal Depository Library Program?<br /><br />Establishing depository libraries as the local service center of government accessibility will require infrastructure investment (to update, make efficient library buildings) and technology resources (specialty scanning/printing machines, broadband lines, computers, etc). But if all 1,250 are turned into local reference points for government data, a few servers and data storage sites will reasonably accommodate a computing cloud architecture. <br /><br />Decentralizing data collection and storage throughout the United States will allow for quicker, less burdensome, and hopefully more thorough content generation. At the very least, local librarians will have a sharper eye for local resources than a DC-based office. Also, duplicating online storage will hopefully prevent the sort of catastrophic data losses seen when a well-intentioned federal agency simply runs out of storage or accidentally deletes critical documents.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Currently these libraries are filled with dusty records of little interest or use to most, and often suffer huge gaps in what they can offer by subject or year. It isn't uncommon to find a particular series of documents with entire chunks ate out of them (not to mention those tragedies where a leaky roof is responsible for decades of lost material).<br /><br />Modernizing these libraries will give this transparency effort a physical infrastructure and existing staff. If paired with cloud computing data storage, local depositories can reestablish the link between government data and the public intended by the FDLP's charter. Moreover, the public good of local resources for information management gives a great set of tools to the average citizen with an interest in government. It would likely be easier for individual states and municipalities to match the federal government with transparency of their own--and this is exactly where trained neighborhood librarian become critical assets to any lasting commitment to transparency.<br /><br />The advantage to FDLP is that a) these libraries are already a point of contact for the public trying to better understand the government; b) they're publicly funded, so it would be easy to budget; c) the regional distribution of these records allows for, say, scanning devices to be distributed locally and thus easing the reporting burden on various agencies (as well as limiting the chance of records being lost in the mail); and finally it may be the only thing that saves the FDLP program from death by irrelevance.<br /><br />For good or ill, we've pretty much removed the point of federal depositories. Most of them don't even contain recent reports because, as any good librarian will now tell you, it's all online. Problem is there's a big risk taken by an educated democracy when it just stops printing copies of its documents. Folks just a couple of days ago lost contact to Google and something like 5% of the entire internet froze--we should have a resilient network to prevent this from happening to our government.</div><br />	solorzanomilton	24	29	5	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2563-4049	
2564-4049	Open Data Principles	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Adopt the open data principles articulated by Carl Malamud and team. From http://resource.org/8_principles.html<br /><br />Government data shall be considered open if it is made public in a way that complies with the principles below:<br /><br />1. Complete: All public data is made available. Public data is data that is not subject to valid privacy, security or privilege limitations.<br />2. Primary: Data is as collected at the source, with the highest possible level of granularity, not in aggregate or modified forms.<br />3. Timely: Data is made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data.<br />4. Accessible: Data is available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes.<br />5. Machine processable: Data is reasonably structured to allow automated processing.<br />6. Non-discriminatory: Data is available to anyone, with no requirement of registration.<br />7. Non-proprietary: Data is available in a format over which no entity has exclusive control.<br />8. License-free: Data is not subject to any copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret regulation. Reasonable privacy, security and privilege restrictions may be allowed. <br /><br />Compliance must be reviewable.<br /><br />Definitions<br /><br />1. "public" means:<br />The Open Government Data principles do not address what data should be public and open. Privacy, security, and other concerns may legally (and rightly) prevent data sets from being shared with the public.

Examples include documents, databases of contracts, transcripts of hearings, and audio/visual recordings of events.<br /><br />While non-electronic information resources, such as physical artifacts, are not subject to the Open Government Data principles, it is always encouraged that such resources be made available electronically to the extent feasible.<br /><br />3.

It's important that the data be machine-processable in bulk so that outside programmers can create new, more useful interfaces to it, much as consumer applications like Google Maps have created new valuable applications on top of government mapping and GPS data. The data should be in its original form, rather than in derivative formats. If the original format is a proprietary file format, data should be provided in multiple formats if possib;e (e.g. Microsoft word file, PDF file), rather than just one. But if only one is available, it should be the format in which the data was created. (Agencies often release PDFs of documents only, which are difficult to process programmatically.) Data release should be timely, as immediate as possible, so it doesn't grow stale before it can be used.)</div><br />	tim	83	91	8	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2564-4049	
2566-4049	Best Practices in government stakeholder involvement	2009-05-21 00:00:00	As a former eGovernment program manager during the Bush Administration, I experienced deeply how difficult it is to effect this type of change in government. While there is certainly a need for wholesale revamping of approaches, I believe that two changes can help get things moving while the overall system catches up. Both relate to best practices.<br /><br />First, engender an information approach that errs on the side of openness. The government needs to have a philosophy that encourages openness and speed over bureaucracy. So, put in place a system that makes information available, but recognizes that this means some glitches, and that the process understands that there will be mistakes, allows for them by streamlining an ability to fix them and quickly responds to any issues identified.<br /><br />Second, look for those programs and people that have already demonstrated a track record of success in opening government programs and information. These people have often been labeled renegades in the bureaucracy, but they can effect change if they are identified, empowered, and mined for the wealth of experience and knowledge they have.<br /><br />For example, David Boyd at the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology has long demonstrated the ability to design and run programs that facilitate the stakeholders' full involvement in a government program. These people can not only be the ones who lead new efforts, but can provide a wealth of information on bureaucratic impediments to progress. They've learned from a lifetime in the trenches.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The founding fathers set up the federal government to resist rapid inappropriate change through a web of checks and balances. While this is key to the endurance and greatness of the United States, it also has its drawbacks which have multiplied over the years, and left too much stagnancy in government.</div><br />	hines.chip	17	21	4	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2566-4049

2568-4049	Open electronic voting	2009-05-21 00:00:00	A major impediment to transparent government is the widespread use of insecure electronic voting machines. These machines have been shown to be easily hackable, thus opening the door wide to voter fraud. Ultimately, an election might be rigged entirely, with no way to do a "recount" to correctly determine the will of the electorate.<br /><br />A transparent government would mandate that all electronic voting machine hardware and software, from the machine in the polling booth to the collection systems used to collate results, would be subject to publication and verification as true open source software. Every citizen has the right to ensure that their vote is properly and fairly counted. Having the entire process open to the public eye is the only proven way of not only ensuring fair elections, but also allowing a process whereby each voter can assure themselves that the process is verifiably fair and impartial.<br /><br />Sean Ahern<br />Computer Scientist<br />Oak Ridge National Laboratory<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The idea is important because representative democracy hinges upon properly representing the will of the people. If elections are able to be rigged or otherwise thrown in undetectable ways, this threatens the very fabric of our government at all levels.</div><br />	opengov	59	79	20	5	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2568-4049

2571-4049	Start with the Decision to Disclose	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Openness means disclosure, followed by dissemination, which enables further interactions. But too often government agencies never make it past the first step - the decision to disclose. And so this is where reform efforts should start.<br /><br />Despite the President's declared commitment to disclosure, not even the White House meets the standard that he has set. For example, the public cannot access Obama Administration Presidential Policy Directives (PPDs) or Policy Study Directives (PSDs) through the White House web site, even when such directives are unclassified. The problem is not that the directives are in the wrong digital format, but that they have not been officially released in any format.<br /><br />The failure to disclose is widespread. The intelligence community's Open Source Center will not release its products even when they are unclassified and non-copyrighted. The Central Intelligence Agency will not release a digital version of its CREST database of declassified historical records. The military services have migrated much of their unclassified content away from the public web and placed it behind access-controlled portals. And so on.<br /><br />Therefore, new emphasis should be placed on affirmative disclosure requirements. New mechanisms are needed to induce agencies to reconsider non-disclosure practices, and to adjudicate difficult cases. While the FOIA can facilitate access to particular records, it is not well-suited to the release of entire record categories.<br /><br />One way to encourage improvements in disclosure practices would be to task agency CIOs to facilitate release of all non-exempt records, and to respond to public requests for modification of existing policies.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The initial disclosure decision is the indispensable foundation for transparency and all that flows from it.

This is basically the idea of the URI/URN in the semantic RDF language. By starting with links to definitions, we can integrate this approach with existing data bases.

In case of valid usage it should show a green sign for a given agency, but in case of any kind of suspicious activity it should change to orange or red, so if the lawful owner of that SSN would look at the SSN Security Dashboard (SSN Usage Portal interface to the public) they would have an early warning, and they could start asking question from that agency thus prompting them to take action if needed.<br />I fully understand, that this is not a cheap proposition however fighting identity theft is not that cheap either, and perhaps substantial amount money could be saved at the end of the day.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It would bring more security to the individuals thus elevating the trust of the public in the Government's basic role of protecting them, could be a highly efficient crime prevention measure, and in overall could prevent any escalation of an identity theft in progress.</div><br />	andras.heimann	12	20	8	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2595-4049	
2596-4049	A “Blueprint” for the ‘Reinvestment phase’ of the “American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009”	2009-05-21 00:00:00	A)We must rise from the wrongs that have been exposed in our financial institutions. Now would be an ideal time to reflect on all of our fundamental foundations, many are broken but can be fixed and greatly improved.<br /> <br />It is not just the last eight (8) years we should reflect on, but the last sixty (60) years. Let us acknowledge our mistakes and correct them through the best of our abilities. Whether products, services or our behavior towards them, all can be bettered through logical processessuch as quality control methodologies and continuously improving.<br /><br />B) Understand that this particular concept of quality and continuous improvement was taught and implemented many years ago by Dr. Walter A. Shewhart, Dr. W. Edwards Deming and others. As currently mentioned by the W. Edwards Deming Institute, "Quality control is that branch of engineering and manufacturing, which deals with the assurance and failure testing in design and production of products or services, to meet or exceed customers' requirements."1 <br /><br />We prefer to use the word consumers, also known as: customers, clients, patients, constituents, citizens, the "little guys", etc. The word consumer transcends all political affiliations, liberals and conservatives, "do-gooders" and "obstructionists" after all is said and done, we are all consumers.<br /><br />C) One of the first issues of this "blueprint", is to open a dialogue between consumers and what we call, 'the four (4) main pillars' of The American Recovery and Reinvest Act of 2009 (ARRA). Those pillars are, in no particular order: governmental agencies, private industries, 501(c)(3) non profits and faith-based ministries.<br /><br />D) We should formulate, primarily with consumers and the 'four pillars' all having equal input, what could be defined as "Best in Class, Best in services, practices, products, etc. From these defined concepts would come a set of standards. These standards should be in place in all major communities throughout the United States.<br /><br /><br />E) Together and with the administration's new IT Leadership, we should start preparing for changes coming from this transformation. There is a definite need to strengthen existing consumer laws, rules and regulations and legislate new ones, if necessary. This is paramount as we explore our behaviors governing political, socio-economic and spiritual beliefs. <br /><br />F) We should seek quality control methodology in all processes to assure that our reward systems are aligned for this transition. Utilize the gifts of technological innovations and create new 'green' facilities for people to work in a collaborative setting.<br /><br />G) Within these settings, we could produce sustainable (renewable) energy sources, preventative health care products including the newest proven advances in life sciences. Joined together with these products are agricultural innovations in the growth of specific plants to help humankind. Quality procedures in communications and services throughout all industries should be implemented and used to increase effectiveness, productivity and profit.<br /><br />H) We have choices to make and a limited time in which to accomplish this. Let us communicate and work together, develop into teams of thought and action. "Roll up our sleeves" and get to work creating sustainable communities that will continuously improve our lives and those of our children and the elderly.<br /><br />Now is that time to come together, "brush-off from our shoulders" the stigmas of failure and frustration. Build those communities that will rise like the Phoenix, soaring to new heights and having American Quality lead the way--peaceful, harmonious and strong in our renewed convictions. Unparalleled throughout the world, as we vie in friendly competition with our fellow global neighbors.<br /><br />As a patriot once said, "Let's Roll!"<br /><br /><br /><br />1 The aim of the W. Edwards Deming Institute is to foster understanding of The Deming System of Profound Knowledge to advance commerce, prosperity, and peace.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Copyright © Peopletech, 2000…All rights reserved<br /><br />Peopletech * 8837 W.

Getting people back to work on these products and services is of the utmost importance.</div><br />	people	3	13	10	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2596-4049

Open Government include educating the public on using this technology.

2599-4049	Deploy Unused Federal Assets in Timely Manner for Natural Disasters	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Examine, discuss and plan for the use of rapid deployment of Federal Assets such as Fixed and Rotary Wing aircraft to proactively support areas in need due to impending or existing natural disaster within the U.S.<br /><br />Time and time again, state and local governments do not have the resources with which to adequately support preventative, or reactive measures to Natural Disasters that our citizen's fall victim to.<br /><br />A latest case-in-point, and this stuff becomes so recurring it sheds light on the inefficiency at which government is often run, was the recent Firestorm in California. This was a known, high risk situation for years in a metropolitan city/area.<br /><br />Basically the federal assets exist in large numbers, and are often just grounded in waiting or deployed in training. Let's concert the non use of these kinds of assets to rapidly deploy within our own cities/area to support preventative measures and support measures to minimize disasters, collateral damages and potentially avert altogether.<br /><br />One simple example would be to deploy Air assets to carry fire retardants and fire suppression payloads in sufficient force and in a timely manner, when firestorm risks are high in a metro/city. To my friends in the mid-west, Central and Eastern states this is not like trying to prevent or minimize a Tornado or Hurricane or, an earthquake in the West. Although, emerging technologies may allow for some of that in the future. <br /><br />As a super simple example, whatever happened to the simple rainmaker techniques to prevent and supress firestorm? It's likely that kind of prevention and suppression requires too many assets for local and state governments to support ongoing in the scale required for effectiveness.<br /><br />So, in this theortical discussion, federal assets would be rapidly deployed for prevention and suppression methods until such time that they may (I repeat may) have to be rapidly redeployed into potentially higher priority national or international security missions.<br /><br />In the end though, my point is that lives and property can be safeguarded and in this exampl. Where those two elements are involved, I believe the federal government should have some responsibility in providing timely and masterfully planned/executed support.<br /><br />I think this can be extrapolated out a long way, forms a foundation for leadership in this important issue in the citizen's protection and quality of life and may spark additional development/advancements in natural disaster countermeasures.<br /><br />Having been in the U.S. Military and having worked extensively within enormous Department of Defense Aerospace projects, the assets exist and are routinely otherwise under utilized.<br /><br />Just my non-professional 2 cents and my first stab a subject within this new forum, so please no hate mail. And no, I don't work for the Fire Deparment's or National Forest Services.<br /><br />John Ruben<br />Simi Valley, California<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Saving lives and property within our own country. </div><br />	Johnruuu	16	24	8	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2599-4049	
2600-4049	Child Support should be transparent	2009-05-21 00:00:00	As child support stands a non-custodial parent is pays %33 net of his/her income â&euro;&ldquo;that is before taxes and other items.<br /><br />However, once it has been paid the parent has no rights to know what the money is used for. The non-custodial parent (child supporter) must pay taxes on this money and receives no tax deductions!<br /><br />With no legal means to know if the money is being used to support the child or children, and no legal tools to prevent abuse of the money. The parent is able to bring the other to court every three years and ask for an increase.<br /><br />It would be fair a just have the options (by law) in support money deposited in a "child support" account and transparent to both parents and the courts. <br /><br />Also, child support should be tax deductible in helping the financial sacrifice made and supporting two health and affordable homes for the children.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>For too long the child support has in times been used as a weapon of power over another and is unfairly balanced in favor of one parent -this is sexist and suggested the other is not of equal in parenting.<br /><br />The person paying child support has very little legal tools to monitor what is to be money for the children. Living, food, clothing, medical are examples of what the money is rightly needed for. Beer, drugs, parents clothing, concert tickets are some examples of items that could be considered non-supportive while the other sacrifices financially.<br /></div><br />	joshsenecal	9	24	15	7	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2600-4049

2604-4049	Fix the Classification System	2009-05-21 00:00:00	There is a near-universal consensus that the national security classification system sweeps too broadly and that it restricts too much information for too long. Overclassification not only has disruptive effects within government (as noted, for example, by the 9/11 Commission), but it is also poisonous to democratic governance.<br /><br />Revamping the classification system should be a priority.<br /><br />In particular, a focused, public review of the classification policies of each classifying agency is needed to reassess classification practices and to eliminate obsolete or inappropriate classification instructions. Existing classification oversight capacity should be supplemented with routine inspector general audits of classification activity. Declassification authority should be expanded beyond the originating agency, particularly with respect to historical records. New forums for resolving classification disputes should be established.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Erroneous or abusive classification impoverishes and corrupts public discourse.

There should be a reasonable coherent justification for keeping records classified for lengthy periods or indefinitely. There should also be a default time period for having classified records become automatically declassified. No records should be classified in perpetuity without a very good reason.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>A record can remain classified long after the rationale for keeping it secret has expired. Records ought to be declassified automatically when there is no public benefit to keeping them secret. This ought to free up a lot of historically valuable records and reduce the administrative burden of FOIA request management. The person making the original classification should be able to contemplate a time frame after which an automatic declassification should be harmless or otherwise in the public interest. </div><br />	stephen.liss	52	59	7	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2607-4049	
2608-4049	Answer Suggestions from the Public	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Diversity of thought is an important American characteristic. We hold a variety of opinions for a variety of reasons, and these varying perspectives allow us to consider a wide range of options.<br /><br />What I would like to see are official, direct, concise answers to questions and comments from the public about the major issues of the day. We do not expect to agree on every issue. Two people cannot do that, let alone hundreds of millions of Americans.<br /><br />What we can expect is that the principles behind decisions should be articulated publicly, in clear, accessible language. When the White House or top Cabinet officials take a stance on an issue, or are asked to take a stance by the public, part of that process can involve a Press Release, blog posting, or similar form of communication that succinctly explains the reasoning and responds to the legitimate arguments supporting a different approach.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>An important part of a democratic society is the right of those who disagree with a position to understand why the particular course of action is being pursued. When principles are articulated publicly, it ensures that those same principles are applied equally forcefully in other areas. If the presented reasoning is incomplete or misguided, government officials will benefit from feedback to that extent from the general public.</div><br />	ndempsey	48	58	10	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2608-4049

Currently government officials can do this merely by classifying illegal acts and policies.<br /><br />For example, the Bush administration explicitly threatened to prosecute the New York Times for publishing articles about the government spying illegally on its own citizens, a threat that made the paper hesitate to publish.

The problem is automatic inter-agency and federal/state/local transfer of information without your knowledge. The initial idea behind this was to track terrorists, pedophiles, and organized crime but it has expanded to all citizens. The concept of "trust us we are doing this for your own good" no longer flies. <br /><br />There is no longer anonymity from the government in all matters of life this needs to change or the United States will become a police state.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Protection of anonymity from the government and right to privacy are key concepts provided by the constitution.

2613-4049	Federal, State and Local Data Consolidation	2009-05-21 00:00:00	In the old days, information was a one-way avenue; government would distribute information to news and media outlets that then added their political or demographic agenda and redistributed it to the general public in the form of censored TV newscasts, radio shows and other legacy media outlets. <br /><br />Welcome to the 21st century and to a world driven by information technology shared and crowdsourced by social media such as blogs, wikis, forums and social networks, where we have experienced a shift in the process of information and data, a time when the power does not reside with those that hold the information, but with those who share it. We all know that government and democracy died behind closed doors. For many years our generation sat on the backseat sharing and collaborating information by using our cell phones and social networks more efficiently and faster than any other government agency using multi-million software technologies. <br />Today, the type of democratized information our generation shares and collaborates still does not exist in our government. What we have is the equivalent of a locomotive and central generator power house government, co-existing in a world of advanced high speed bullet trains and the age of the power grid. The technology to consolidate and share government information has already been invented and is already in used by your average 12 year old that shares information by writing a blog entry into his MySpace, posting a YouTube video or twitting his latest "status".<br /><br />How do we accomplish data consolidation?<br /><br />Let's define the purpose of data accessibility and consolidation, why would we want to do this? <br /><br />•Efficiency<br />•Transparency<br />•Accountability<br />•Participation<br />•Collaboration<br />•And to bridge the gap between our generation and government.<br /><br />Before I delve into each category and why this idea is important, let's assume Data.gov has launched and some government data is now easily accessible.<br /><br />Let me paint a real-life scenario, let's assume federal, state, and local government data was easily accessible and consolidated into one single data feed and source at Data.gov. What we would have would then yield useful applications that could have a significant impact for "we the people".<br /><br />For example, let's study an application designed for the Washington D.C. area named iLive.at. This application allows you to put in your home address on your phone or personal computer and based on that address, it informs you of the crimes that happened in your neighborhood, the closest bank and things of interest near you. It lets you find the buses and trains and when they are coming. So it really takes all those state and local government data feeds and gives them to you in the context of your address, presented in an interface that is not only useful but easy to understand. Now to this application add the ability for any citizen to be able to comment, rate and contribute content in the form of pictures, videos and blog entries.<br />This application is the prime example of consolidated government data feeds we the people can benefit from. Let's not stop at the application level, instead let's assume that keeping with the spirit of one of our most innovative information technology companies, Google, we create a "government suite" of applications based on the concept of collaborative, open standards and consolidated federal, state and local data feeds. A suite of applications that when downloaded to our mobile phones, laptops and personal computers allows to share, participate and be part of the inner workings of our federal, state and local government, all thanks to data consolidation.<br /><br />By Erick Gonzalez<br />U.S. Navy Veteran and Government 2.0 Consultant<br />Erick.gonzalez@oracle.com<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>•Government Efficiency<br />•Transparency<br />•Accountability<br />•Participation<br />•Collaboration<br />•And to bridge the gap between our generation and government.</div><br />	erick.gonzalez	38	51	13	9	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2613-4049

2616-4049	Chagora	2009-05-21 00:00:00	There's a link between money, speech and the ability to participate. Political MicroDonation (under $1) with Electoral/Geographic Networking is vital for scaling representation. Especially in grassroots issue or legislative lobbying and for new candidates and ideas.<br /><br />It's the Power of Small Money, Large Numbers & Immediate Feedback!<br /><br />It's a fundamental of speech and association.<br /><br />(Chagora is NOT Monetized via any addition to transaction costs!)<br /><br />A Charity and Cause/Campaign Service Provider Characterized by Associated Individual Donor Accounts accessed via the Recipient's and others' Chagora widget or the Chagora website itself which is Attractive to Recipient charitable and issue/candidate oriented nonprofits because of its enablement of Exclusive Transaction & Feedback Capabilities of vital interest to Donors and the general public.*<br /><br />Chagora Assumptions<br /><br /> 1. CHARITY and especially POLITICAL MICRODONATION (Cause/ Candidate contribution under $1 alone or in concert with others) has very Powerful and Unrecognized Potential as a USER ATTRACTANT If it can be made easy enough for the donor to give and economically feasible for the recipient to receive.<br /> 2. And can CATALYZE Donor usage of this account for ALL CONTRIBUTION in both the POLITICAL AND CHARITY sectors for reasons of convenience, unified accounting, reporting and additional functionality and benefits discussed elsewhere.<br /> 3. The CHAGORA System thus is attractive to potential charity and/or candidate/cause Recipients BOTH because of the direct services Chagora offers (accounting, reporting, visibility, specialized group fundraising capabilities, unique charity/corporate sponsorship capabilities, etc.) AND the ready Donor-base it can provide.<br /> 4. And forms the basis for a Long Tail Aggregator with high-margin profitability NOT dependent on advertising or transaction fees.<br /><br />The Power of Small Money, Large Numbers & Immediate Feedback!<br /><br />Attempts to revitalize our political system have focused attention on the issue of money in politics. All are good tries, and all are from the wrong end. It's not just too much big money… it's too little SMALL money. Political MicroDonation under $1 is a proximity substitute for conditions under which Representative Governments first arose and operate best… and are essential for scaling better leader development and decision making.<br /><br />When teamed with more effective information gathering and dispersal (e.g. Sunlight Foundation, etc.) as well as new technologies of association (OpenSocial Initiative, Causes, etc.) its capabilities will be quickly seen and hence its growth will be self-reinforcing...<br /><br />Most people never give to a cause or campaign… They will! They don't give now because they assume they can't make a difference… It's too much, too rare and too difficult!<br /><br />They're hungry for a voice; a mechanism to bring them IN. Chagora does it and does it profitably. The design as a for-profit structure with ultimate exit-strategy by ownership transfer to the Donor-base is a unique element intended as a check & balance mechanism empowering the commons in a reasoned way against imbalances concurrent with civilization scaling.<br /><br />The Mechanism and the Fish<br /><br />Political MicroDonation is a catalyst and needed an enabling mechanism. And the enabling mechanism itself is a Hook for a priceless fish. The Fish is a natural concentration of Donors gravitating to such a system... And an essential tool for empowering citizens in the commons!<br /><br />How does it work<br /><br />The Donor's P.U.D Account (Pooled, User-Determined Account) with accounting and reporting makes previously non-viable and therefore non-existent transactions feasible and FUN.<br /><br />Essentially the User participates in a Chagora Trust account with as little as $10 and relinquishes ownership of deposited money, but retains full discretion on its distribution (within defined limits relating to charitable or cause-based entities).<br /><br />Further, the account, once established persists whether funded or not and has functions related to social networking for civic purposes which are expanded on elsewhere. Chagora takes no part of the transaction between the donor and recipient. CHAGORA's Design Structure suggests that even those with NO interest in politics at all will eventually be drawn in as well!<br /><br />Monetization<br /><br />Recipient Subscription Fees, Charity and Cause/Campaign Services, Charity-Corporate Sponsorships, Accounting Services, FEC (and other) Reporting Services, Supplementary Web & Tech Services, Event Media Fees, etc.<br /><br />*This user-controlled specialized account has additional potentials depending on a number of factors and its application in different countries and legal systems will vary... however its underlying fundamentals are universal.<br /><br />Prototype & FAQ http://www.Chagora.com/faq.aspx<br />Blog http http://CulturalEngineer.blogspot.com <br />LinkedIn http://www.linkedin.com/in/culturalengineer<br />facebook http://profile.to/culturalengineer/<br />twitter id http://twitter.com/CulturalNgineer<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The broader Chagora concept (Individuallly-Controlled/Commons-Dedicated Account) is as a for-profit structure but with profit and governance to the donor base (not via government intermediary)as an essential public mechanism and an essential piece of the necessary mechanisms for rebalancing the tension between the individual and the commons.<br /><br />In briefest, I believe there are ample bootstrapping opportunities via cooperative endeavours with various neutral or "meta"-political sites like the Personal Democracy Forum, the Sunlight Foundation, Congressional Quarterly, Brennan Center for Justice, C-Span, Break the Matrix, etc.<br /><br />Overview at http://www.netsquared.org/projects/chagora</div><br />	culturalengineer	-12	7	19	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2616-4049

2625-4049	Reporting Expenditure of Stimulus Construction Appropriations	2009-05-21 00:00:00	OMB's RAT Board Chairman Earl Devaney has complained that the transparency respecting expenditure of stimulus legislation funds on the Recovery.gov website will require most of his $84 million oversight budget, and over a year to develop. Federal and state agencies can't agree on how much detail should be included in reports on construction projects funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. <br /><br />I have an idea that won't require creation of a single additional piece of paper. How about assigning a unique identifying number to each individual project funded in whole or in part by these appropriations. Create a database attaching the identifier with the brief project description already included in the front end of every government construction contract. Then, link the identifier to .pdf copies of the contractor's sworn statement and lien waivers already submitted with each monthly pay request on every government construction job.<br /><br />This way, citizens interested in the progress and efficiency of any particular project could quickly drill down to a complete list of every business that was paid any money for labor or materials on the project. Furthermore, neither the bureaucrats nor the contractors on the project would have to write up a single document they are not already required to prepare. As far as I can tell all this information is already required to be public under the freedom of information laws in every state anyway, so no one's toes get stepped on, and no one has to do any extra work. Just run the sworn statements and lien waivers through a scanner every month and e-mail them to Devaney's folks in Washington, D.C. for electronic insertion into the database. Nobody even has to spend money on stamps. Mission accomplished.<br /><br />Devaney is defending the failure of Recovery.gov to include more detailed information because, he says, he is "worried about overburdening small businesses," according to the MacGillis newspaper story. Someone with knowledge of public construction contracting practices ought to tell Devaney that all of this information is already required of, and reported by, construction contractors every time they apply for payment on a government project, right down to the names, addresses and amounts paid to every subcontractor and material supplier who gets any money on the job. Without these lien waivers, the general contractor won't get paid. Asking the local or state government agency to scan the lien waivers and sworn statements and e-mail them to Devaney's folks in Washington D.C. would probably require six minutes per month per project out of the busy workday of some government secretary in a state or local agency office. No additional burden is placed on either the contractor or the contracting government agency.<br /><br />There are no secrets in these pay request packages, and as far as I can tell the documents are already publicly available under the freedom of information laws in every American jurisdiction, so all that is needed is forwarding them to Devaney and his staff, and posting them on Devaney's Recovery.gov website. <br /><br />The failure of the folks in Washington D.C. to accept this simple truth is utterly astonishing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It is simple, elegant and requires no one to create or submit documents which aren't already in use on every government construction project.</div><br />	james.mcconnell	59	66	7	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2625-4049

2632-4049	Promise USA - National Network of Citizen Conversation	2009-05-21 00:00:00	What if Americans of all ages, races, backgrounds and beliefs could come together in a series of national conversations on topics of significant importance to the nation? <br /><br />What if we could create a listening and learning environment through structured conversations to lead us to better understand one another, establish common ground and transform ideas into action? <br /><br />What if all of us had a role in making this a reality?<br /><br />Promise USA proposes a series of national conversations, initiated by the Obamas, which invite citizens to explore questions of importance to all. <br /><br />Until now, it was impossible to have a two-way Fireside Chat. Today, we have well-researched and documented dialogic methodologies that make it possible to engage citizens in a networked, real-time, face-to-face, national conversation. Our Promise USA Team is comprised of respected experts in large-scale conversation who will partner with many other dialogue and deliberation facilitators throughout the nation.<br /><br />What if we brought our collective expertise in conversational leadership forward to confront the challenges that the nation faces?<br /><br />Promise USA Conversations would begin with the President or First Lady posing the questions for national intergenerational conversations. These questions would enable citizens to focus on strengths and opportunities that inspire personal commitment and action. <br /><br />In venues as small as living rooms and as large as auditoriums or convention centers, people would be seated together at tables of four or five. These Promise USA Conversations would start with a question on a national issue. People would explore ideas for 30 minutes and then move to a new table to discuss a related question on a local level, concluding with a final round that brings the conversation to an individual level and encourages commitment to action. Ideas generated at tables and commitments to action would be shared and recorded across the nation.<br /><br />To generate momentum and urgency, President and First Lady would attend one of these conversations. After brief introductory remarks, broadcast nationwide to all locations, the President would pose a single question that engages groups in every venue in compelling conversation on topics such as education, health care, energy and the environment. <br /><br />Several "Citizen Conversations" would be scheduled throughout the year, with the President and First Lady beginning each subsequent event with a quick update on their learning and highlights of actions taken as a result of a previous Promise USA event.<br /><br />Having youth organizations such as the Girl Scouts facilitate the pilot conversations would enrich Promise USA. Other promising young people would be engaged to co-host subsequent conversations. Creating an intergenerational environment whenever possible will enliven the learning and allow community understanding to emerge. When people of all ages are invited into conversations that matter, people listen better, work harder to understand and consider the future with their heads and hearts. <br /><br />We have many thoughts about variations on this process and welcome your ideas and input.<br /><br />We promise to build on our experience as pioneers in large-scale change and community dialogue. <br /><br />We promise to quickly and efficiently engage as many Americans as possible in the work of changing this country. <br /><br />We promise to ignite social networks to spark a new way for communities and our nation to work together. <br /><br />We will activate grass roots youth movements such as the Girl Scouts, as we have in the past, to pilot the conversations across the country. We will invite other young people to co-host subsequent conversations.<br /><br />We will engage those working in the fields of dialogue and deliberation, large-scale change and Asset Based Community Development and use the power of self-organization to stimulate strength-based citizen action.<br /><br />We will scale the intergenerational conversations to exponentially increase the number of facilitators, conversations and citizens involved. By November 2012, a connected web of thousands of cities and towns across the land will be providing citizen perspectives and innovative solutions to our local and national challenges.<br /><br />We invite you, President and First Lady Obama, to join us with your sponsorship, leadership and presence. <br /><br />We invite you to attend at least the first Promise USA National Conversation. <br /><br />We invite you to provide a live or recorded update on your learning and highlights of actions taken as a result of the previous Promise USA event. <br /><br />Together, we will invite the American people to fulfill the promise of the USA: of the people, by the people, for the people.<br /><br />PROMISE USA TEAM<br /> <br />CHRISTINE WHITNEY SANCHEZ has coordinated and facilitated some of the largest intergenerational conversations in the world.

2634-4049	Equal Representation Through the Elimination of Congressional Districts	2009-05-21 00:00:00	To grant each state its specified number of representatives in Congress, we have devised a system not founded in the Constitution - Congressional districts. Each state is split up into geographical regions approved by the state legislatures and signed by the state governor. Under this system, each geographical district elects one representative who is then supposed to represent those people by voting, debating, and speaking with the will of their district in mind. Members of that district have no say about the state's other Congressional districts - just theirs.<br /><br />As is always with people, manipulation of the system is bound to occur. Districts are, as I said above, drawn by the state legislature, which is a very partisan institution (as are most political institutions, sadly), so they tend to reflect what's best for the majority party at the time the districts were created. Not only do parties get disenfranchised, all sorts of communities - minorities in particular - get the shaft in this system. All the person in power wants to do is continue holding that power for as long as possible; therefore, they try to stack the odds in their favour by drawing districts in such a way that they are almost always assured a win next election. If they can win in a majority of the districts in the state, they win the entire state, regardless of what the other districts say. Power-hungry politicians, then, sometimes try to draw district lines in a way that negates the effect of the opposing vote in a process called "gerrymandering." If there are a lot of Republicans in a certain area, and Democrats control the state legislature, they may elect to split up those Republicans into several districts, so they can't ban together and have power. Another method is to cede a district or several districts to their opponents, and put all Republicans into those districts, making sure that Democrats will still control all the others and thus control the state.<br /><br />While these techniques are technically illegal (due to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and several laws in the 1980s), the U.S. Congress will sometimes look over gerrymandering as long as it's not blatantly obvious that a party or group is trying to discriminate against another party or group. In other words, if you're clever enough to make it look like you had no idea you were putting your opponents at too much of a disadvantage. With enough political whit and manipulation, stacking the odds in your favour are still possible.<br /><br />This, in my opinion, does not signify equality; it signifies the opposite - oppression. If I live in a gerrymandered district and have views differing from the group for which that district was gerrymandered, I may as well not vote; it won't count, or it will count so little that it won't matter anyway. I'm effectively stripped of the ability to vote for someone sharing my beliefs. What are my options? Well, I could move to another district that supports my opinions, but why should I have to uproot my job, my family, and my entire life just because some power-hungry politician doesn't care about me? I should be able to live in any location I please and have just as much say as my neighbour, who may be my exact opposite.<br /><br />In order to accomplish this, I have a proposal: Eliminate Congressional districts. Instead of forcing me to vote for only one of my state's representatives, who probably won't get elected if I live in a gerrymandered district, let me vote for all of them. The chances of me getting at least one representative that truly represents my values is much greater. If I'm a Republican in a highly Democratic area, I can vote for a Republican, and that guy may still get into office. In the current system, there are representatives which hold "safe seats" in Congress. Their districts contain a large majority of their party, and no one from the other party even has a chance, so their opponents may as well stay home and not run - or move elsewhere; they have no say. Eliminating Congressional districts would effectively eliminate safe seats as well. Just because people in your area agree with you doesn't mean everyone in your state does. Now the representative not only has to worry about keeping his biased district happy (an easy feat), but he has to worry about the entire state. I envision the ballots of each state to contain a pool of people, more than likely twice the number of positions.. but not confined to that. In Mississippi (my state), for 4 positions there could possibly be 50 people from which you choose. Naturally, a person will choose the 4 people closest to their beliefs. After voting, the 4 candidates with the most votes would be the representatives because they had the most supporters. This would apply to all states, so in California the top 53 would be representatives, and so on. This would be a popular vote based system, so every person's vote would be equal to that of another person, and not just "roughly equal" as laid out by the Equal Protection Clause. There would be true equality instead of the perversion we have now.<br /><br />Doing this would allow you to have a say for every person representing you - not just one. If you choose not to vote for all 53, you don't have to. Trying to distinguish between 2 candidates is already hard enough; I wouldn't want to even attempt to think about 53. My reply to this is: That's why we have the power of abstaining. Even though there are 53 spots to fill, you don't have to vote for 53 people. You can choose to vote for only 5 or 6 - or even only 1 if you'd like. Any sensible person would find their top choices and check their names, not really caring about the others. If they have 5 or 6 representatives, they're happy. In fact, they'd be happier under my system than the current one! Instead of only having one representative, they could potentially have 20-30 (even all 53!) representing their ideals. They would have more people agreeing with them, and thus would be better represented in Congress as a whole. In essence, while you have the ability to vote for all 53, you aren't forced to. Vote for whomever you want, and the top 53 will get in.<br /><br />This system would not only empower the average American and give him/her a more active role in their government; it would make the House of Representatives reflect the ideals of the American people much more closely than currently. The "People's Branch" would actually become the People's Branch.<br /><br />So in conclusion, my proposal is to eliminate Congressional districts and replace them with candidate pools. People will have the ability (but not the obligation) to vote for all of the representatives in their state and not be confined to just one. A person in an area of conflicting beliefs will still have a voice and be more encouraged to vote. And Congress would reflect the will of the American people more closely... What's not to like about that?<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Increases government interaction, Makes the House of Representatives reflect the population more accurately, Removes the ability to gerrymander, Makes election races less negative.</div><br />	dudemanfellabra	-13	17	30	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2634-4049

2648-4049	End Corporate Laziness with an International Trade Treaty	2009-05-21 00:00:00	We need to form an alliance/treaty with several other developed nations (UK, France, Germany, Japan, Australia, etc.) and produce a list of foreign countries determined to have "acceptable" labour laws (minimum wage, safe working conditions, etc.). If a country doesn't meet the necessary requirements, all the countries under the treaty should put a heavy tax on imports from that country, making their products cost more than domestic products or products from treaty members. Since businesses in countries with poor labour laws won't be able to profit much from the treaty members (where most of the global capital is), those countries will be pressured to enact better labour laws, promoting safe and humane working conditions globally. Also, since Americans would buy domestic or treaty member products (which would have little to no import tax on them compared to non-treaty members), American businesses would be forced to finally do some R&D; and try to find better methods of reducing cost to make their products, so they can compete against the treaty members.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Stimulates corporate R&D;, incentivizes global labour laws</div><br />	dudemanfellabra	2	18	16	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2648-4049

We accomplished this by implementing an intuitive expert system development environment with web2.0 technology as a hosted service, so everything is accessible via the internet. <br /><br />Developers build applications with only a browser, and users access those same applications with only a browser.<br /><br />Applications walk users through complex procedures, asking questions, presenting information as rich media, and taking different paths depending on the answers users provide. Since the logic and rich media content making up these applications is robust, there are a wide range of applications possible with such a system. <br /><br />Examples include:<br />Training and Tutorial Systems (ie. How to file paperwork properly)<br />'Smart' Shopping Experiences (ie. Review tourist resources on the Washington Mall)<br />Decision Support Applications (ie. Applications of policy or procedures)<br />Price Quoting Applications (ie. Filing taxes, paying fines, Making contributions)<br />Document and literature fulfillment solutions<br /><br />Applications may be constructed from reusable logic 'pieces' which may be combined into complete applications.

2662-4049	Create a New Cable Channel Devoted to Delivering News and Information About the Government	2009-05-21 00:00:00	I suggest that the government create a cable TV channel that broadcasts news and information about the government 24/7. I don't mean a single program - I mean an entire channel devoted to information about our government. The programming would be exciting and interesting. It could feature:<br /><br />- breaking news<br />- daily news<br />- call-in programs<br />- a series on a particular topic<br />- some private programs, like Ken Burns' documentary about the Civil War<br />- the president's weekly address<br />- guest speakers from different areas of the government <br />- late night talk shows<br />- programming slots devoted to the different branches of government <br />- shows for kids<br />- educational programs<br /><br />It would have to be staffed and run by experienced private-sector people. It would have to be engaging and fun, as well as informative. That's achievable when you have multiple programs, not just one, like the President's weekly address. <br /><br />The government could pass legislation saying that all cable channels must carry this station for free, uninterrupted. There is existing legislation governing the cable companies, so there is precedent.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>- A TV channel would be the easiest way to get information out to all Americans.<br /><br /><br /><br />- Most people don't have computers or iPods so they can't access the information that the government is currently producing. Most of us here on this forum are extremely tech-savvy. We have computers, iPods, and 3G phones which allow us to get news and information when we want it. But most Americans do NOT own these technologies. As a result, many American citizens do not have access to the government in a way that meets their needs. But everyone has a TV (or 2 or 3) in their home already! <br /><br /><br /><br />- Most people don't have time to seek out information about our government. Even tech-savvy people. But TV is so easy. You just turn it on. You can watch it during dinner. You can be cooking or folding laundry while you watch. You sure can't fold laundry and be on the computer at the same time!<br /><br /><br /><br />- Many people have absolutely no interest in sitting in front of a computer. My grandparents, for example, just flat-out refuse. I'm sure they are not alone. Many people do not have the interest or aptitude (or the money!) to learn about computers and iPods. And a lot of people have absolutely no technical skills. As a result, they can't access all this new whiz-bang stuff that is being used now (email, podcasting, videocasting, websites). <br /><br /><br /><br />- There is no source of unbiased, "straight from the horse's mouth" information from the government (yes, we have C-SPAN, but nobody actually watches it). Existing TV channels are biased. The public TV stations are mostly liberal (and boring). <br /><br /><br /><br />- It can also be watched by our fellow human beings in other countries, just like they watch CNN right now.</div><br />	kfitzmorgan	-34	20	54	8	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2662-4049	
2666-4049	Electoral College Reform	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Let us not forget what happened in the Presidental election of 2000. We need to reform the Electoral College system, and it can be done fairly and without a Constitutional Amendment. Congress needs to pass a law requiring all states to adopt proportional allocation of Electoral votes. In other words, if the Republican candidate receives 45% of the votes in a state, he or she gets 45% of the Electoral votes (instead of ZERO, as it now stands in 48 states). This is fair, it's simple, and easily doable.<br /><br />If we can't get rid of of this dinosaur of a system, then this reform idea certainly fixes the problem -- and quickly. Done.

Why should someone have their credit worthiness trashed because of hard times. If you miss a payment or have to return your car to the bank because of being laid-off, it should not hurt your for 7 years. 6-12 months should be enough while most hardworking Americans rebound from economic hardship situations within a year. why let the banks charge us more interest to fill their already huge pockets when families are working hard to feed their families. Their should be a new Fair Credit ACT stating that negative information should not stay on your report for more than 12 months. See what hurts the American people the most is all those fees and interest we have to pay because of this bullet proof system that the banks made up by them selves. The credit report agencies are own by the banks so they will do anything to make you look bad so that they can charge you more.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>We need to loosen the rope around the American peoples necks and let opportunity and prosperity a new chance to start all over. If the banks can not excuse them selves why they want to charge us more interest and fees, we the American people will save more for our kids and their future, or a student, single parent or family.

2671-4049	An educated populace is necessary for good government	2009-05-21 00:00:00	As was observed by both Plato and Aristotle 2500 years ago, an educated population is necessary for democratic processes to work. Simply establishing machinery for access to decision makers is not enough. To achieve the goal of an educated population, one must reconstitute the school system. This means establishing a mandatory curriculum that includes philosophy and critical thinking at all levels. Getting people to participate in decision making always has been a serious problem, as people are so concerned with the every day minutiae of their lives. Too, one must ask at what level and to what degree should they participate. Government is so large and often overwhelming.

2675-4049	A Workers Compensation Manifesto	2009-05-21 00:00:00	We, the Injured Workers of United States of Amrerica contend the following iniquities of the Workers' Compensation System.<br />• The Workers Compensation System does NOT enforce its own laws and statutes<br />already in place for the benefit of injured workers:<br />a. Timely diagnosis and medical treatment and approval of such treatment<br />within the time frame set by existing laws <br />b. Timely automatic benefits within the time frame set by existing law<br />• The Workers Compensation system often obtains medical as well as personal information on injured workers which has no pertinence to the claim and serves no necessary purpose in resolving the claim, but rather is used as a tactic to deter and frighten claimants out of litigation and into unfair settlement.<br />• The Workers Compensation System willfully prolongs litigation, knowing the compensations courts are overloaded with cases, causing further severe psychological, physical and financial<br />damage to the claimants, in hopes of pushing claimants into premature and unfair settlement.<br />• The Workers Compensation System takes advantage of their exemption from repercussion or liability from lawsuit leaving injured workers with no recourse.<br />• The Workers Compensation System knowingly and willingly makes fraudulent charges against many claimants in order to intimidate them and to avoid having to medically or financially compensate claimants.<br />• The Workers Compensation System consistently cuts and denies benefits in order to starve claimants out and force their acceptance of inadequate, unfair settlements, causing many claimants to lose everything they have worked for i.e.; homes, vehicles, savings, etc; and forcing many into bankruptcy, loss of credit standing, and even loss of family and spouses in many cases. and resulting in suicide of others.<br />• The Workers Compensation System forces injured workers back to work on a light duty status prior to their recovery until their compensation has expired and then their employer discriminates against them with termination because they are unable to perform their job at 100% capability.<br />• The Workers Compensation System consistently contends that claimants attorney fees are the major cause for insurance premium increases to the employer when in fact litigation in the majority of cases is NOT pursued by the claimant until the Workers Compensation System forces the claimant to seek an attorney because he has been continuously denied necessary medical treatment, medications and/or supplemental benefits.. The system itself is in fact, the cause of most compensation related litigation.<br />• The Workers Compensation System is in collusion with many physicians to deny diagnosis and treatment in favor of getting the claimant back to work despite their medical problems, willfully neglecting needed treatment many physicians comply because to buck the system means the loss of a substantial number of patients.<br />• The Workers Compensation System willfully and knowingly shifts the burden of<br />responsibility for permanently disabled injured workers onto the already over burdened Social Security Disability system for which the injured worker paid half, himself. Why is the Workers Compensation System allowed to get off the hook and shift this burden?<br />There are many more iniquities of the Workers Compensation System, that are too numerous to list one by one, but an investigation into the Workers Compensation system of any individual state will begin to reveal these iniquities enough to convince you that further investigation is indeed warranted.<br />We feel confident, that you as the guardians of our great nation and representatives of we, the people, will share our concerns and act upon our request for help.<br />WORKERS COMPENSATION<br />A Modern Fairy Tale<br />Once upon a time, in the greatest nation in the world, the United States Congress passed the "Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970", (or the OSHA act). It was a very, very good law for the hard working people of this very great nation. It said:<br />"...the vast majority of American workers, and their families, are dependant on workmen's (sic worker's) compensation for their basic economic security in the event such worker suffers disabling injury in the course of their employment; and that the full protection of American workers from job-related injury or death requires an adequate, prompt, and equitable system of workmen's compensation as well as an effective program of occupational health and safety regulation..."<br />A short time later, The American Congress remarked:<br />"In recent years serious questions have been raised concerning the fairness and adequacy of present workmen's compensation laws in light of the growth of the economy, the changing nature of the labor force, increases in medical knowledge, changes in the hazards associated with various types of employment, new technology creating new risks to health and safety, and increases in the general level of wages and the cost of living."<br />Because of these serious concerns, the Congress established the National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Statutes to "undertake a comprehensive study and evaluation of State workmen's compensation laws in order to determine if such laws provide an adequate, prompt and equitable system of compensation." July 31, 1972, was the date Congress decided upon for the transmittal of the report of the Commission to the President and Congress. The Commission was a large un-unified group, and no one truly expected them to complete the report on time (as often happens in large committees). But, lo and behold, to everyone's surprise, the report was completed and turned over right on time, and our tale continues.<br />The 1972 Commission concluded: "...State workmen's compensation laws are, in general neither adequate nor equitable...Perhaps in another decade or two, an attractive alternative to workmen's compensation will emerge...For the foreseeable future we are convinced that, if our recommendations for a modern workmen's compensation program are adopted, the program should be retained."<br />It was asked by some, why this problem had gone unresolved for so long. "We know why," responded the Commission. There are numerous reasons:<br />a. Lack of interest by State legislatures and the general public<br />b. Lack of understanding by State legislatures and the general public<br />c. In-fighting among special interest groups<br />d. The complexity of the problems<br />e. The irrational fear that the increases in premiums would drive employers<br />away to States with less generous benefits and lower costs. (THIS was called "The Main Barrier."<br />The Congress, OSHA and the Commission knew they had to conquer "The Main<br />Barrier" before the problem could be resolved. Could they ever find the solution? YES!<br />After considering an immediate complete federal takeover, after considering voluntary guidelines followed by a complete federal takeover in a few years if deficiencies are not corrected promptly, the Commission decided that the main barrier could be overcome if: The States were required to meet<br />certain minimum standards for the essential requirements of a State workmen's compensation law no later than July 1, 1975.<br />Now, you might very well be asking, "What are these Essential Elements" established by that great and benevolent Commission, so very long ago and meant to be fully complied with by the date of <br />July 1, 1975 <br />THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS:<br />1. Compulsory Coverage<br />2. No occupational or numerical exemptions to coverage<br />3. Full coverage of work related diseases<br />4. Full medical and physical rehabilitation services without arbitrary limits<br />5. Employee's choice of jurisdiction for filing interstate claims<br />6. Adequate weekly cash payments for Temporary Total Disability (TTD),<br />Permanent Total Disability (PTD) and Death cases<br />7. No arbitrary limits on duration or sum of benefits<br />The commission voted unanimously that Congressional intervention may be needed to bring about reforms in the State systems. The threat of, or if necessary, the enactment of Federal mandates will remove from each State the main barrier to effective workmen's compensation reform: The terrible irrational fear that compensation costs may drive employers to move away to States where protection for disabled workers is inadequate but less expensive. The Commission, on a majority vote, gave the States until July 1, 1975 to comply with The Essential Elements.<br />Keeping in mind, that this Commission mandated total compliance by the States by the date of July 1, 1975, you the reader must have concluded that this Fairy Tale had to have a happy ending as do all good Fairy Tale's. Sadly, I must inform you that THIS Fairy Tale has NO happy ending.<br />As of this date, July 1, 2001, almost 26 years to the day that this mandate was supposed to have been complied with, NOT EVEN ONE STATE OUT OF 50 HAS COMPLIED WITH THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS! In fact, not even one State out of 50 has even come close to compliance!<br />The truth of the matter is that, in the intervening 26 years since this mandate was proclaimed, the individual State Worker's Compensation Systems have further deteriorated to such a devastating degree that they are not even remotely as adequate as they were when the Commission decided they were inadequate enough to mandate The Essential elements!<br />An American worker who becomes injured under today's individual State Workers' Compensation Systems has become a victim of a holocaust, unequalled and unparalleled in American history. <br />We, the Injured Workers of America have waited twenty six years for Congressional intervention which was promised when the Essential Elements Mandate was proposed.<br /><br />It's time for our Congress to act on that promise.<br />Originally created 2-1-2001 by:<br />VOICES INC.<br />7900-20 103rd Street<br />Suite 16<br />Jax, Fl 32210<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This is an important issue because the workers in the United States of America are being cheated, damaged, and sometimes even driven to suicide by big business and greedy insurance companies. The Chamber of Commerce Lobby pushes the States to keep injured workers from their rightful benefits thus maximizing business profits at the expense of the worker.</div><br />	Gclanman	-17	9	26	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2675-4049	
2676-4049	ISLAMIC BANKING	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Interest is a way used to take unlawful money from people. If you borrowed $100 from someone, you would want to owe the same amount, not a penny more. you would not want to owe $110, unless you yourself reward him that amount. Islamic Banking is the way to go, as they are the only systems to survive the economic crises. <br /><br /> Banks such as Citi and HSBC have recently begun applying some of the concepts and are being among the successful in comparison with those who did not apply. something must be right in this system that is encouraging the banks to apply Islamic Banking. In Islamic Banking, you will not be cheated by the financing charges you whether it is $50 or even a penny. You will be charged the same amount of money you borrowed. Interest makes greed and encourages the taking of unlawful money from the people like you.<br /><br />If by for any reason you make a late payment, late fees are prohibited. what can be done is increase the customers minimum payment in a way it does not exceed that amount the person owes in total. If payed on time the next time, the bank would give that person a discount, or lower the minimum payment as a reward.<br /> <br /> Take mortgage for example, instead of loaning the buyer to purchase an item, the bank might buy the item from the seller and resell it for a profit and does not charge late penalties, as this is also usury gains. Many banks have taken heavy blows due to their unlawful ways of dealing with people and their money, while those who applied Islamic Banking have taken a limited blow. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>You will not be charged interest, finance charges, late fees or any other fees in a way to be cheated of your wealth.<br /><br />If banks applied this concept long ago, the economic crises might have been prevented or otherwise, less severe than it currently is.<br /><br />More banks worldwide, such as HSBC and Citi that i recently mentioned have applied this method.<br /><br />All benefit.<br /><br />There must be something right if Western banks are applying the Islamic method of banking.</div><br />	ahmad_aldick	-23	21	44	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2676-4049

2678-4049	Provide a reference information system and service to improve communication between everyone and computers.	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Title: Provide a reference information system and service to improve communication between everyone (e.g., people, groups, organizations, cultures, nations) and computers.<br /><br /><br />People need information to perform at their best level and to make their best decisions. Much of that information now comes from information systems over a network such as the Internet. These information systems have database, business rule, and business-process logic parts in the software, as well as hardware and network parts. <br /><br /><br />The databases, rules, processes, and logic are built using the natural language (e.g., US English) of the developer, project manager, system analyst, requirements analyst, functional manager, portfolio/investment manager, financial manager, and executive manager.<br /><br /><br />But what happens to the information systems and all of the parts needed to build it if all of these people involved in creating and operating it DO NOT speak the same language? Answer: The information system is not built, or is built with many errors, faults, deficiencies, and misunderstandings. <br /><br /><br />Imagine how far building this information system would progress if each person involved only understood 20% of what the person before them and after them in the building sequence was saying, writing, or drawing. That would be the case if each person in the development process spoke a different natural language like English, French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, etc.<br /><br /><br />You might think that since everyone on a US English-speaking team happens to speak and write using the same natural language, that they would have much better communication. They would, because of that shared language and the education, society, and culture behind it. But even with the same natural language, a large percentage (e.g., 25%) of the words that are used by a person, and how they are used, in the process, would not be understood by those around them. <br /><br /><br />This 25% of unknown words (i.e., the meanings are not known) and how they are used (i.e., their situation), causes enough errors in communication to cause individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and combinations of these to "fail to communicate" and thus fail or fall short in their endeavors. This 25% of unknown words are typically called "jargon". Everyone has and uses their own jargon. It forms and evolves naturally. Reconciling and reducing the jargon is where the discipline of society, education, and culture comes into play.<br /><br /><br />If you look at the typical cost of developing an information system, the highest cost is not for the hardware, software, network services, operations staff, or managers. The highest single cost for any information system, in both developing it and repairing it, is the cost of analyzing and specifying the information requirements to be satisfied by the system, including its data, data structure (i.e., metadata), business rules, activity sequence (i.e., process), and controls over the process.<br /><br /><br />In the same way that a specific type of technology is widely used today in translating between natural languages, that same technology needs to be applied, using a consistent process, to translate between the persons and groups within an endeavor who are using jargon. Jargon blocks transparency (i.e., it enables hiding), reduces operational effectiveness and efficiency, and makes accountability, discipline, consistency, cohesiveness, and cooperation difficult.<br /><br /><br />If you create and make available an information system that is used to collect and organize what people mean by their words and symbols, in their writing, speech, and images, and in what situation each meaning applies, then the ability to analyze and specify information requirements could then be largely automated. This type of information system is called a Terminology Server. <br /><br /><br />Terminology servers range from: <br /><br /><br />>very simple low-capability and limited-audience terminologies (e.g., glossaries, dictionaries),<br /><br /><br />> to medium-capability and medium-audience (e.g., above capabilities plus taxonomies, and simple concept models such as concept maps, concept of operation models, and conceptual data models), <br /><br /><br />>to high-capability and broad-audience (e.g., above capabilities plus thesaurus, and richer concept models such as Logical Data Models for database schema, Object Role Models for class structures, Architecture metamodels with Architecture models, Configuration Management datamodels and Asset data, Process Models, Ontologies with knowledge-bases, and Axiologies with value-chains). Note that this high level terminology server combines, but need not replace, the functions and content of several other types of IT-management and operations-management technologies.<br /><br /><br />Even more essential than the terminology server is a terminology process to guide the terminology-developers through the various capability levels from low to high. By following a consistent terminology process, the much sought-after "semantic interoperability" for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and overall data, person, group, community, and organization interoperability can be achieved using the high-level terminology, and the very expensive requirement analysis and specification for information systems can then be large automated.<br /><br /><br />What I propose is a terminology-enabled operations management and improvement (TOMI) system and service, provided to the nation as a shared reference by the Federal Government. I have published my approach for building and maintaining this TOMI capability into the public domain at http://sites.google.com/a/one-world-is.org/gem-ema/Home/gem-approach/2-gem-methodology/data-architecture-terminology. What you can do with a TOMI system is described at http://gem-ema.one-world-is.org. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Communication at all levels: person, group, organization, community, computer, and all combinations of these requires a shared terminology. No share terminology no communication. Limited shared terminology - poor communication. Fully shared terminology - full communication. Governing our vocabulary well gives us the ability to govern everything well.</div><br />	Roy Roebuck	-8	6	14	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2678-4049

Federal government can take a lead role in addressing a major shortcoming in the market economy -understand true costs of goods and services.

2693-4049	Let's Be Clear on the Terminology about "Public Engagement"	2009-05-21 00:00:00	We need to better define the terms that we are using in order to have a better discussion about how we achieve Open Government.<br /><br />If we all have different ideas about what is (and is not) "public engagement" or "transparency" or (insert buzzword here), then we will have a hard time reaching consensus about how to go forward. (This is the lesson from "The Tower of Babel".)<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />"Public Engagement" -- If a government official gives a speech to the public, does that qualify as "public engagement"? (Some people at the White House think so.)<br /><br />"Transparent" -- Some people speak as if government "transparency" does not currently exist. But others see it as a quality that can be measured (i.e., we have some now, but would like to be "more transparent").<br /><br />"Participation" vs. "Collaboration" -- What's the difference between these terms? Can a person collaborate on a proposal *without* participating (or vice-versa)?<br /><br />Other "fuzzwords" that need clarification in order for citizens to decide whether to participate: "townhall meeting" (aka, "town meeting"), "informational hearing", "public forum", "scoping meeting", "listening session", etc.<br /><br />Most people DO want to know "what's going on". However, before they decide to get involved, it first needs to CLEAR to them just what they might be getting themselves into. If the invitation is unclear, the public will ignore it.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Citizens will NOT participate in "public engagement" if it is UNCLEAR to them.<br /><br /><br /><br />If we want to make government "more participatory", then we first need to "more transparent" (i.e. more clear) about the words that we use to describe those goals. If we let those words turn into vague buzzwords, then our discussions and decisions will also be vague and, therefore, unclear to others on how to implement them. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />respectfully,<br /><br />Stephen Buckley<br /><br />www.UStransparency.com </div><br />	Stephen Buckley	26	34	8	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2693-4049

In the last few years, there were several attempts by agency leadership to either fire their IG or obstruct the efforts of IG personnel, such as at the CIA, State Department and GSA. Congress has tried to give IG's some degree of independence, but they still answer to the people they should be criticizing in their reports. The best solution is to create a Cabinet-level Inspector General who answers directly to the President, runs a single Inspector General agency that oversees all federal agencies and provides independent oversight of federal agencies. IG's that answer to an agency head will never be completely independent and those agencies will never be truly transparent or fully accountable for their actions.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Federal agencies need truly independent oversight and investigation of internal wrong-doing, or else they will be ineffective at carrying out their work and will lose the confidence of the American people. </div><br />	chaodown	18	28	10	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2697-4049

Events can seemingly come and go like changing seasons. Some of us are in a position to move, to change, and to expand. But what about if that affects one's own level of personal comfort, even if the change could be wholly beneficial? The U.S. has become far too comfortable as a whole and we are slowly loosing grip of the reality of how harsh this world really is, we are becoming more concerned with television programs to entertain our children than real programs to actually help them survive the future. The general populous seems to want to imagine a romanticized world where every person is "happy". Happiness is a perception of one's own state of being, i.e. what makes me happy doesn't necessarily make you feel the same. Currently we have a government in the U.S. that, to us mostly laymen, seems like an unstoppable force. Whether you see it as a good force, or a bad force, a force it certainly is. A force that, currently, seems to thrive on the venom of vindictive action against an entity known as: "Terrorist". A terrorist is frankly, someone who causes a sense of terror to advance an agenda, i.e. 224 years ago when British colonist rebelled against their king, they too, where labeled terrorist. In this sense, any entity to attack a perceived enemy, is well, a terrorist. But that word carries some heavy weight, where does the wordâ&euro;&trade;s application stop? Just hearing the word brings up memories of 9/11, destruction & dismay, and a general sense of fear from the unknown. To those who the U.S. would deem terrorist, they see themselves as revolutionaries, martyrs, people who, in their eyes, are stopping a beast from invading their lands, their ideals, much as we would if presented with similar circumstance. Remember, people want happiness and comfort, and the majority will do what is needed to attain that goal and make it last. That is why most wars are fought, pure and simple. To obtain a state of happiness for one's self, a sense of security. For some rulers of history past this meant conquest for supreme power and to others the exact opposite through treaties for peace, but all outcomes where roughly the same. Eventually the fighting stopped and the ruling powers returned to their kingly affairs. Whether their interest was in their subjects or themselves, they no longer had to worry about a bordering state invading them and vice versa, instead they had a new source for free resources or they had a new trading partner, either way, both goals attempt to obtain comfort, stability, and a general sense of happiness.<br /><br />The Idea:<br />We need to move away from technological happiness, or as I view it, lulled comfort. While technology is an amazing, constantly evolving organism, it's application is severely limited due to it's effect on the environment and the masses. Why you may ask? Because a majority of technology relies too heavily on other factors i.e. electricity and other natural resources. Throughout history there have been searches to find perfect renewable resource such as the fabled Philosopher's stone, but all of these have turned up nothing. Nothing that could be generally applied. I purpose a co-existence with technology here in America. To where most people will equally know, for instance, the value of a home garden, or at least, have the ability to produce one if they so desired, next to knowledge of, say, what ABC has next fall for it's line up . The focus in this country should be how are we going to survive the next 100 years, not Mr. Obama or the next guy's term. General education of techniques that have been keeping people alive for the past 2,000 years, such as farming, building a shelter from the land, basic survival skills, etc. should be given serious consideration by state and federal governments and taught in public classes, for adults and children. Tax incentives should be given to folks who join up to teach. Now what if, but certainly hopefully not, something terrible happens, and as a result, our country breaks down, to the point where it is in utter chaos, such as the current situation in many areas of Iraq. What then? All those hours wasted with Grand Theft Auto and American Idol could have been used to further your own development. But don't get me wrong, entertainment is needed for our human mind, just in quantity. We need to find a balance between desire and necessity or else our future will not last that long if our only goals are the consumption of material goods to obtain a sense of "happiness". This is what addicts do, achieve that current "high", and then move to the next best thing. Our culture is very much in this addict mode, just look at how the media excitement is over new studio movies or a celebrity's new thing. These things embody what many people view as Happiness. We want to imagine, or romanticize about what it could be like if we were in the movie or if we were the celebrity. This is not reality, but a lulled state of being, to where one's cares leave the emotional realm and enter the material. A focus should be put on fellowship over ownership, Nature education over digital sedation. To learn survival skills and it's applications for the future can bring lasting happiness and security to any mind. To have the confidence to know that you have the skills at hand that at any moment, you could feed your family and not have to rely on loan notes we affectionately call money so you can go to a grocery store and buy what you could have harvested one's own self. Technology is not inherently evil, just widely misused, and now, is slowly numbing the populous to forget their roots and plan for their future. Move away from Facebook and put your face in a book on how to grow food, how to culture ground for use, or even how to paint, create, or to somehow further your life in anyway with the goal: for the good of all creatures of the Earth, because this will, of course, benefit mankind as a whole. Communal learning, cultural evolution, it's how people got to where we are today and what weâ&euro;&trade;ll need for tomorrow. The culture of America is becoming digital, it needs to return to the camp fire. We each have our part to bear in this life. What we do with it, in the end, only truly matters to the bearer.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The ability for the common man to produce their own food, shelter, and well being through education of the land and the nature of our world is most important. These survival skills should be basic for all people. What happens if the economy breaks down and the Internet goes poof? All contact would be gone, chaos would ensue, and the dark ages would most certainly return. People need to stop solely relying on man-made devices and take some power back for themselves. <br />Be prepared and be ready to survive, cause really, in the end, it can only help us. <br /></div><br />	gbtorsion	-11	7	18	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2700-4049

It should direct consultation with the public in the development of the new executive order, as took place in the prior administration, and require publication of a proposed new executive order in the Federal Register before it is submitted to the president. The directive should instruct that the new executive order on classification:<br /><br />• Include standards that must be satisfied before records can be classified, as well as prohibitions and limitations against abuse;<br />• Establish additional procedures to ensure that any decisions to reclassify previously declassified records are clearly justified in order to limit the amount of declassified information that is removed from the public sphere;<br />• Require agencies to consider the damage to national security and to the public interest from classifying information;<br />• Establish processes for the dissemination of substantive information to state and local authorities and, ultimately, the American people;<br />• Direct classifiers to use the lowest appropriate classification level and the shortest appropriate duration for classification; and<br />• Set up mechanisms for oversight within each agency, including independent declassification advisory boards, systems to track classification decisions, regular auditing and training, and remedies for improper classification decisions.<br /><br />- From the 21st Century RTK Agenda<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	21stCenturyRTK	23	31	8	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2703-4049

While not all requests are appropriate for publication, the default for a modern FOIA request should be both digital and public, with support for paper-based or non-public requests still available.

Furthermore, it is essential for accountability that government officials know that decision making that may be secret for a period will eventually be subject to analysis and review. Government activities in the national security and foreign relations areas are of tremendous interest to the public, both in terms of ensuring our actual security and because the records that chronicle the actions of government officials and document our national experience provide the transparency necessary for a healthy and vital democracy. The culture of information control at agencies will not change without a commitment from the president and support from Congress for a new approach, such as that generally embodied in the recent recommendations of the Public Interest Declassification Board. An omnibus Historical Records Act should be enacted in order to facilitate the declassification of historically significant information in a timely manner, bring greater consistency and efficiency to the declassification process, consider the significant public interest in the declassification of historical records, and reduce the burden and delay inherent in the current declassification process.<br /><br />- From the 21st Century RTK Agenda<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	21stCenturyRTK	29	33	4	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2708-4049	
2709-4049	Protect federal workers from retaliation by security clearance	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Problem: The voices of some of government's most conscientious and competent employees are routinely silenced by managers who threaten to revoke their security clearances. While most of those with clearance work in defense and intelligence roles, by no means is the problem confined to CIA, NSA, DHS, DOD and the FBI. Many employees at agencies like the Department of Agriculture also hold clearances. Many of those required to hold clearances have little if any real need for them. But, agency managers find a security clearances a handy way to make an end run around laws that protect workers from discrimination, whistleblower retaliation, politicization, cronyism, and other abuses. Under the rules established by Executive Order, agencies can fire an employee with a clearance for virtually any reason. Employees who appeal a revocation or suspension have almost no due process protections - and even those are not guaranteed because there is no external review of the agency's decision. Inexplicably, private sector employees with security clearances have more due process rights than federal employees working on the same federal programs. As whistleblowers, no matter where they work in federal government, are a critical element of transparency and accountability, this problem urgently needs correction.<br /><br />Proposed solution: The Obama administration should therefore reverse its opposition (stated through the Department of Justice) to a provision of H.R. 1507 that gives intelligence agency employees the right to file civil suits in federal district courts for relief from whistleblower retaliation, including relief for violations of due process in adjudicating security clearance revocations. The GAO has found that giving employees access to federal district courts poses no threat to national security, as the courts already have special procedures in place to protect national security information.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	deep_harm	34	42	8	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2709-4049

Other groups believe that as courts created the state secrets privilege, the responsibility to exercise oversight and establish boundaries for the privilege must also fall to the courts.

2723-4049	No Agency Business to be Conducted on Non-Agency Email	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Regulations should be promulgated to make it explicit that agency employees and officials - in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Records Act - may not conduct agency business through use of non-agency email or other messaging systems. As e-mail has become a dominant form of communication within government, the importance of maintaining an accurate record of those communications has grown as well. Recent instances at both the federal and state levels have demonstrated that in addition to better archiving of government e-mail records, a stronger policy is needed on use of non-governmental e-mail accounts. Policies should strongly reinforce the Federal Regulations Act's restriction that communications on public/government matters should be conducted through official e-mail accounts.<br /><br />However, given that the problem continues to arise despite the existing guidance, additional requirements should be established in the event that government matters are discussed through non-governmental or personal e-mail accounts. In such circumstances, officials should be required to preserve and make public these records, or at least the portion related to official business.<br /><br />- From the 21st Century RTK Agenda<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	21stCenturyRTK	49	54	5	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2723-4049

A CIO Council task force should develop standards for authenticating government documents for the public through an open process that includes review of past efforts.

2727-4049	Improve Oversight of Intelligence and National Security Activity	2009-05-21 00:00:00	The president should require agency heads to task agency inspectors general to perform regular audits of agency compliance with executive order requirements on classification and declassification. Thousands of executive branch personnel are authorized to create new classified information, but only a dozen or so individuals are authorized to perform independent oversight of such classification actions. Inspectors general, who are already in place at each agency, should be directed to perform periodic audits of classification and declassification activity to ensure that classification is properly applied and limited to the essential minimum.<br /><br />The Government Accountability Office (GAO) should be enlisted to conduct regular intelligence oversight. GAO is among the most effective and skillful instruments of government oversight available. It performs audits and investigations of programs and activities throughout the government, with the exception of the U.S. intelligence community. The intelligence community has traditionally declined to participate in GAO inquiries that â&euro;&oelig;evaluate intelligence activities, programs, capability, and operations,â&euro;? according to the Director of National Intelligence, because to do so, the DNI says, could compromise intelligence sources and methods. That is a pretext, not a legitimate argument. The GAO has 1,000 employees with Top Secret clearances, including several dozen with Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) clearances for access to intelligence information. These employees oversee highly classified programs outside of the intelligence community. There has never been a compromise of classified information originating at GAO.<br /><br />The president should actively cooperate with congressional oversight and recognize that oversight is a healthy component of American government. The executive branch should be responsive to requests for document production and make administration officials available to testify under oath before Congress. The president should order each agency to fully cooperate with any investigation or inquiry into the accountability of government activities related to national security and homeland security actions. This includes criminal investigation or prosecution, congressional investigation or inquiry, appointed commission inquiry, or executive branch investigation or audit. Agencies should be instructed to provide relevant records, making personnel available to testify under oath, and declassifying records and information so that an accounting may be provided to the public. Such investigations could cover domestic surveillance, rendition, detention, or interrogation. Further, the president should minimize the assertion of executive or other privileges and invoke them only when essential.<br /><br />- From the 21st Century RTK Agenda<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	21stCenturyRTK	37	49	12	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2727-4049

Scientists and researchers, like any federal employees, have a right to express their personal views outside of a few narrow restrictions. Provided that scientists make an explicit disclaimer that they are speaking as private citizens and are not seeking to represent official agency policy, they should be allowed to speak freely about their research and to offer their scientific opinions - even in situations where their research may be controversial or have implications for agency policy. Agency policies governing communication with the media should make this option clear and explicit to employees. Such a "personal views" disclaimer does not, of course, cover the release of information that would otherwise be illegal, such as classified or personal information. Additionally, agencies should be encouraged to create a mechanism to allow non-scientific employees to express their opinions on actions, research, or policy within their areas of experience.<br /><br />- From the 21st Century RTK Agenda<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	21stCenturyRTK	51	56	5	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2728-4049

Secret law that is inaccessible to the public is inherently antithetical to democracy and foreign to the tradition of open publication that has characterized most of American legal history. Many consider such secret laws to be inherently illegal. Yet there has been a discernable increase in secret law and regulation in recent years. Among the examples of secret law are secret interpretations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, secret opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel, secret presidential directives, and secret transportation security directives. While there are occasions when some presidential directives should legitimately be classified and therefore issued in secret, even these exceptions should only remain secret for a reasonable time period. The president should require all agencies to publicly disclose non-classified regulations and rules currently in place and commit to public process for all new regulations and directives.

While editing by non-scientists is at times necessary and useful, final review by scientific experts is essential to ensure that accuracy has been maintained in the clearance process.

Allow them to actually be PAID for their time, too. That would be great for everyone. How about setting aside funds for public participation?

2737-4049	Reduce Secrecy and Increase Openness in the conduct of American Diplomacy and at US Embassies	2009-05-21 00:00:00	A George Kennan put forth: ". . . A large part of a (diplomatic) missionâ&euro;&trade;s work does not involve or require elaborate secrecy. Diplomacy, after all, is not a conspiracy. The best diplomacy is the one that involves the fewest, not the most, secrets -- the one that can be most frankly and freely exposed to the host government . . . The diplomatic mission, above all, was not supposed to be, and had no need to become, a center for espionage. ... It is my conviction, based on 70 seventy years of experience, first as a government official and then in the past 45 years as a historian, that the need by our government for secret intelligence about affairs elsewhere in the world has been vastly over-rated. I would say that something upwards of 95% of what we need to know about foreign countries could be very well obtained by the careful and competent study of perfectly legitimate sources of information open and available to us in the rich library and archival holdings of this country. There may still be areas, very small areas really, in which there is a need to penetrate someone else's curtain of secrecy. All right. But then please, without the erection of false pretenses and elaborate efforts to deceive--and without, to the extent possible--the attempt to maintain "spies" on the adversary's territory. We easily become ourselves, the sufferers from these methods of deception. For they inculcate in their authors, as well as in their intended victims, unlimited cynicism, causing them to lose all realistic understanding of the inter-relationship, in what they are doing, of ends and means." <br /><br />Along the same lines, as George Shultz recommended: <br />- " . . . In this age of openness, we need to think in fresh terms about the collection and analysis of the information needed to inform and carry out our diplomatic objectives. Of course, the photographic and electronic intelligence we have long had should continue. We should be set up to exploit what can be gleamed from the internet. Beyond that, what we need to know about most countries is readily available from open sources ... I see no reason to continue with the notion that every embassy should have a station, with all the extra expense and exposure that brings. Clandestine human collection will still be needed in some countries and with regard to a few subjects, such as terrorism. Such collection efforts should be specifically tasked, and, therefore, managed with care and looked to aggressively for results ... I also favor more, not fewer, small (US) consulates operated on an open basis. A few trained people on the ground can help in the analytical, as well as collection, functions. A small, open consulate can be operated on a low budget. The expense comes when the station comes, with all the accompanying security and secrecy gear." <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>As George Kennan put it: " . . . excessive secrecy, duplicity and clandestine skullduggery are simply not our dish . . . such operations conflict with our traditional standards and compromise our diplomacy in other areas . . . the success of our diplomacy will continue to depend on its inherent honesty and openness. Deprive us of that, and we are deprived of our strongest and most effective weapon." <br /><br /><br /><br />And as Daniel Patrick Moynihan observed: <br /><br />- "A case can be made . . . that secrecy is for losers. For people who don't realize how important information really is. The Soviet Union realized this too late. Openness is now a singular, and singularly American, advantage. We put it in peril by poking along in a mode of an age now past. It is time to dismantle government secrecy, this most pervasive of Cold War-era regulations. It is time to begin building the supports for the era of openness that is already upon us." <br /><br /></div><br />	sheerind	17	32	15	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2737-4049

On the heels of repeated problems with the publication of important studies in various agencies, there has been some movement in the right direction on policies governing review and clearance of scientific materials. However, the manner in which agencies adopt these new policies along with proper oversight and enforcement will be critical to counteract the deep-seated practices of reviewing findings through a political lens and delaying or manipulating reports that conflict with agency policies.

2741-4049	Provide Adequate Funding and Resources for FOIA offices and E-Government Initiatives	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Implement a formula that establishes a minimum percentage of the agencies' Public Affairs Office (PAO) budgets to be spent on FOIA expenses. Without adequate resources devoted to FOIA, agency morale and the ability to fully adhere to the requirements of the law will not likely improve. GAO should be asked to analyze the current funding for FOIA and assess funding sufficiency based on agency size, FOIA personnel, number of requests, and number of pages requested per year. Then the Congressional Budget Office should be asked to generate a formula for appropriate funding of FOIA offices in agencies, which might include an optimum ratio between PAO and FOIA funding. This recommendation might result in the creation of specific line-item budgets for FOIA, rather than its incorporation in general agency funding. As FOIA studies are completed and offer a clearer picture of the problems and challenges being faced at each agency, the formula could be adjusted to specifically address each agency's FOIA needs.<br /><br />The President should instruct agency Chief Information Officers, working with the agency Transparency Officer, to build content management systems such that FOIA-able information can be identified and retrieved. Currently, responding to FOIA requests is labor intensive and expensive for most agencies because their IT systems were not designed to enable the retrieval of older information and records.<br /><br />The president should instruct agency Chief Information Officers, and should task the CIO Council, to develop and publish for comment a strategic plan to rebuild government information dissemination capacity and move agencies into the Web 2.0 world. The government needs to rebuild technical capacity for information dissemination in the agencies (and government-wide), because in recent years, most technical work regarding dissemination has been outsourced, and there is not sufficient capacity among governmental personnel to even oversee the work of contractors, much less develop technical dissemination initiatives within the government. This assessment should include resource needs for building agency technical capacity.<br /><br />OMB/the Office of Transparency should (re)issue guidance on information that must be on agency homepages and should require agency reports on compliance with the requirements of the E-Government Act, the E-FOIA amendments of 1996, and recommendations of the Dissemination/Transparency Working Group. Battles over website real estate often create disincentives to make information easily available. Decisions about what gets posted, and where, vary from agency to agency, and the criteria are at best unclear and generally not disclosed to the public. In recent years, for instance, despite the mandates of the E-Government Act and guidance from OMB that links to FOIA reading rooms be on the homepages of agency websites, these links have been removed from some websites because they are not heavily used or other agency concerns are given priority. Information disclosure links must be easily found and easily used.<br /><br />The next administration should create incentives to convert government documents to no-fee, electronic, publicly available documents. Currently, private companies enter into non-competed agreements with agencies - often Memoranda of Understanding that are not public - and create subscription/charge-based access to public records that they have digitized at "no cost" to the government. There is little ability for alternative models, such as consortia of government entities, libraries, and others, to present themselves as options to maintain no-fee electronic public access in the face of such non-competed agreements.<br /><br />The president should establish incentives for agencies to clear up their backlogs. One incentive would be establishing a technical assistance fund to provide additional support to agencies with significant backlog problems. Some agencies' backlogs are the result of unique issues faced by the agency in responding to requests. Some agencies may handle requests with a greater emphasis on historical records, e-mail communications by officials, or records that require multiple reviews prior to disclosure. This fund would provide such agencies with an opportunity to receive assistance in addressing such challenges. The fund should be established at the Department of Justice or the Office of Government Information Services at the National Archives and Records Administration. The fund would also function as a check on agencies' requests for additional time in responding to requests. In a FOIA lawsuit, an agency can seek an "Open America" stay from the court to grant the agency additional time in responding to a request because its existing backlog prevents that agency from responding until the requests received earlier are cleared.54 Typically, to obtain such a "stay," an agency must show that it is overburdened by requests and is exercising "due diligence" to reduce its backlog of pending requests. Requesting assistance from this fund would be seen a requisite for "due diligence" in trying to reduce backlogs. Therefore, agencies not requesting assistance would be allowed to receive such stays. Another incentive would be a commitment by OMB to allocate more funds to agencies that purchase electronic record and content management systems that meet standards for interoperability and include explicit provision for successfully responding to FOIA and E-discovery demands.<br /><br />- From the 21st Century RTK Agenda<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	21stCenturyRTK	43	47	4	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2741-4049

2743-4049	Provide Incentives to Promote Disclosure	2009-05-21 00:00:00	The president should make transparency a factor in federal employee performance evaluations where it is a part of the job description. Changing the culture of government to be more transparent will require direct individual accountability for employees and supervisors and recognition of work to improve transparency. Too often in the past, information requests have been denied, new online tools delayed, and information removed without any specific official or employee being held responsible for the action - either internally or externally. As much as possible, this accountability should be structured as positive incentives for employees - better performance evaluations for those employees that make strong contributions to ensuring an agency or office is conducting business more transparently.<br /><br />The next administration should require an annual Transparency Scorecard (based on the metrics established by the Working Group) for each agency, with an overall report by OMB, which would be part of the E-Government Act report or a larger Management Reporting structure. Competition is a great incentive when seeking fast changes in performance. Government should create such a competitive incentive by requiring publicly disclosed Transparency Scorecards covering a wide range of agency dissemination activities. Congress should receive the annual OMB report and could request a report from elsewhere, such as GAO, on a regular basis. The possibility of adapting the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) should be explored. A PART review helps identify a program's strengths and weaknesses to inform funding and management decisions aimed at making the program more effective. The assessment would have to be adjusted to both catch transparency/dissemination program failures and analyze why a program falters, as well as what is necessary to strengthen it to accomplish the goals of transparency and dissemination.<br /><br />Transparency awards (Window on Government Award) should be created and regularly given to acknowledge agencies and civil servants that have made government more transparent. Awards are a simple but clear indication of the administration's approval for transparency efforts. Acknowledgement of the best new tools, highest performing offices, and most innovative efforts is one of the best ways to make other parts of government aware of these actions with the hope they will create similar changes elsewhere.<br /><br />- From the 21st Century RTK Agenda<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	21stCenturyRTK	27	33	6	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2743-4049

We needs new laws ASAP that protect the unemployed and ensure the best candidates are hired, and that they are hired based on competencies and skills, not hearsay, personality, a youthful appearance, or friendships. Applicants should not have to give up their safety (W2 history, SSN) in order to apply for a job. They shouldn't have to agree to not hold former employers accountable for defammatory comments. Feedback on applicants should be provided when it is used to exclude a candidate from a position. There should be laws that ensure the initial application process is easy, quick, and non intrusive. Later on in the process applicants actually going to be offered a job can provide all the security data required. Doing so too early in a hiring process forces us to be at risk to anyone calling him or herself a recruiter.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Public safety for all</div><br />	cat-samjas-0l9	17	29	12	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2744-4049	
2745-4049	New Directives to Protect Whisleblowers from Punishment	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Directives and legislation providing protection for whistleblowers who disclose waste, fraud, or abuse within an agency, and punitive processes for managers who retaliate against those whistleblowers in their performance reviews should be established. irectives should clarify to all agencies, including law enforcement and intelligence agencies, the expectation that whistleblowers be robustly defended from reprisals and that whistleblower claims be dealt with quickly and fairly. <br /><br />The president should establish a culture that supports whistleblowers by rewarding disclosure and punishing retaliation in performance appraisals. The president must also work with Congress to enact comprehensive federal whistleblower reform that extends meaningful protections to law enforcement and intelligence agency whistleblowers.<br /><br />- From the 21st Century RTK Agenda<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Whistleblowers play a vital role in ensuring we have a functioning, effective, and accountable government. When governmental checks and balances fail to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse, the responsibility to call notice to a problem and hopefully bring about a resolution often falls to employees. Unfortunately, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, which was enacted to protect federal employees against reprisals for the exposure of government inadequacies, has been rendered largely toothless by judicial decisions. Additionally, there have been recent administrative policies that seek to control and/or limit the speech of scientists, researchers, and policy personnel that might give voice to facts and opinions that differ from the current political agenda. While new legislation is needed to permanently establish increased protections and new whistleblower rights, such as a right to jury trials, much can still be done administratively.<br /><br />Much of the mismanagement, unfair treatment, and limited enforcement of the protections could be rectified with new demands by the president that whistleblower protection be made a priority. </div><br />	21stCenturyRTK	143	158	15	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2745-4049

Few requestors can afford legal bills ranging up to $150,000 simply to track down a document.<br /><br />Building on work already done by federal agencies, OGIS should work with experts to deploy online dispute resolution tools such as social media, online videoconferencing and other communications tools to allow agencies and individuals to collaborate successfully. The federal government should stand ready to collaborate to give the public even greater access to their government, be they in Annapolis or Anchorage. Given that FOIA disputes exist in dozens of federal agencies, OGIS's online transparency and collaboration tools should encourage other offices and agencies to use them as well.</div><br />	Sunshine in Government Initiative	20	28	8	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2748-4049	
2749-4049	Create Institutions to Evaluate Agency Transparency	2009-05-21 00:00:00	The president should create a Dissemination/Transparency Working Group made up of new agency Senior Dissemination/Transparency Officers and task it to establish metrics for outcome (not process) to assess agency transparency and use them to regularly evaluate and report on progress. The group would be headed by the Government Transparency Officer. The working group must fully include outside participants. The Dissemination/Transparency Working Group should be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act.<br /><br />The president should create a public interest review board to advise the government on information dissemination and to provide advice when an agency refuses to disseminate information to the public. Two potential models are administrative law judges and the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP).<br /><br />Administrative law judges preside at an administrative trial-type hearing to resolve a dispute between a government agency and someone affected by a decision of that agency. In adjudicating cases before them, Administrative Law Judges conduct formal trial-type hearings, make findings of fact and law, apply agency regulations, and issue either initial or recommended decisions. Administrative Law Judges have complete decisional independence, and to protect that independence, have "tenure very similar to that provided for Federal judges under the Constitution."<br /><br />The Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP) provides the public and users of the classification system with a forum for further review of classification decisions. ISCAPâ&euro;&trade;s effectiveness as a model is in the disclosures it facilitates in the first place: agencies like to avoid the specter of being reversed on appeal, so they go ahead and release more information on their own than they would otherwise.<br /><br />This board would be distinct from the Public Interest Declassification Board (PIDB), which is an advisory committee established by Congress in order to promote the fullest possible public access to a thorough, accurate, and reliable documentary record of significant U.S. national security decisions and activities.<br /><br />- From the 21st Century RTK Agenda<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	21stCenturyRTK	-3	17	20	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2749-4049	
2750-4049	Make documents produced by government contractors in their role as gov't surrogates subject to FOIA	2009-05-21 00:00:00	The president should direct agencies that when they outsource any of their duties, not limited to records management duties, the contracts should contain provisions specifying that the records produced by the company in its function as a government surrogate belong to the agency and available, as agency records, under FOIA.<br /><br />On Dec. 31, 2007, President Bush signed the OPEN Government Act of 2007 (S. 2488), which includes long-sought reforms of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In response to the outsourcing of so many federal government functions, one provision of the OPEN Government Act extended FOIA to include any information that "would be an agency record" that is maintained by "an entity under Government contract, for the purposes of record management." Currently, the breadth and implementation of this important provision remain untested. The president should clarify the records management responsibility that contractors must abide by and better establish the level of access agencies will provide to contractor produced records.<br /><br />- From the 21st Century RTK Agenda<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Government procurement is the fastest growing part of discretionary spending in the federal government, with roughly 41 cents of every dollar being spent on contracts. Along with this rapid growth in contracting, there has also been a rapid rise in sole-source contracts and contracts with full and open competition but only one bidder. Additionally, there is a concentration of contractors: of the more than 170,000 contractors receiving federal money, the top 20 account for 36 percent of all the money, and the top five account for 22 percent. Such numbers are a clarion call for reforming the procurement process to ensure more transparency.<br /><br />Outsourcing of government's functions is a controversial activity, with both strong opponents and supporters. To the extent it continues, it will have an impact on transparency, as many of our openness laws (e.g., open meetings, FOIA) have not been seen to apply when government outsources its work. All federal contractors performing government functions should be subject to the same openness laws that apply to the federal agency that would otherwise be performing the service or function.<br /><br /></div><br />	21stCenturyRTK	84	89	5	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2750-4049

In some situations, poorly informed decisions can be corrected through appeals, but these cost time and money to pursue. The government needs to do a better job of getting the decision right the first time.

2753-4049	Encourage Legislation to Enforce Transparency	2009-05-21 00:00:00	The president should encourage Congress to establish a criminal penalty for willful concealment or destruction of non-exempt agency records requested under FOIA, as well as penalties for employees and contractors who repeatedly fail to comply with CUI policies and employees and contractors with original classification authority who repeatedly fail to comply with proper classification policies. <br /><br />Such penalties would be the flip side of the criminal prohibition against unauthorized disclosure. Such penalties would occur after an employee or contractor has been notified of non-compliance and has gone through re-training.<br /><br />Enhanced citizen suit power should be explored. A private citizen can bring a lawsuit against a government body for engaging in conduct prohibited by statute. For example, a citizen can sue a corporation under the Clean Water Act for illegally polluting a waterway. A private citizen can also bring a lawsuit against a government body for failing to perform a nondiscretionary duty. For example, a private citizen could sue the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to promulgate regulations that the Clean Water Act required it to develop.

2758-4049	Use existing library networks to implement increased transparency and promotion of greater use of information	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Agencies' implementation of increased transparency and promotion of greater use of information should include strategic and aggressive use of existing library networks, including the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). An important aspect of any effort to increase government transparency is to make sure the public is aware of and able to use the new information. For this, libraries across the nation - public, academic, legal, research, and many others - are perfectly positioned to help notify and explain the new access to the public. Many Americans look to libraries for assistance in finding or understanding information, especially for those members of the public with no or limited Internet access. Libraries provide a broad range of E-Government services and resources but these have not as yet been successfully coordinated with the various Federal agencies. Librarians, as managers of information, can be among the most knowledgeable and effective advocates. Greater public participation in government and expanded use of government information are the true goals of increased transparency, and the federal government should develop a clear plan to use libraries in completing that process to achieve those goals.<br /><br />The president should direct heads of agencies to coordinate E-Government and other programs of information dissemination with libraries in general and with the FDLP more specifically. This program, created by Congress and administered by the Government Printing Office, provides no-fee permanent public access to a broad range of government information.

2759-4049	Measure the relationship between features of collaboration and outcomes for all evidence based programs	2009-05-21 00:00:00	While there is now a mandate that many, if not most, federal and state initiatives use collaboration as both a method of governance and as a mode of decision-making, there is little empirical evidence documenting the influence of collaboration on concrete program outcomes. In fact, several reviews in the public health arena have found that fewer than 20% of all collaborative initiatives produce outcomes that equal or better than those initiatives carried out by a single agency. <br /><br />This does not mean that we should abandon collaboration. But it does mean that we must get much more precise about what makes for successful collaboration. Two known features of highly successful collaboratives are the presence of an open and credible process and the presence of leadership oriented towards fostering and securing that process. An open and credible process has five critical features: 1) It includes all relevant stakeholders (but does not over-include by inviting participants who may represent an important sector but who do not work directly in agencies or with communities directly relevant to the initiative). 2) All stakeholders are treated equally (measured not in formal avenues for participation, but the degree of influence each member perceives he or she has). 3) The process is perceived by stakeholders as authentic (measured by the perception that the process can issue binding decisions and is not a legitimation ritual to satisfy some mandated ideal). 4) It focuses on the root problem. 5) It can be revised when the application of some norm, no matter how well-intentioned, produces unwelcome effects on the process. <br /><br />We need to develop better instruments for measuring these qualities and, more importantly, we need to develop sophisticated modeling techniques that can identify just how these features are related, or not, to concrete program outcomes. These outcomes should be focus on the ability of the program to reach and retain those it serves, that it is delivered with fidelity, and that it produces demonstrable improvements in well-being. Research starting to do this has been published recently (Evaluation Review, Oct 2008). Along with the Presidentâ&euro;&trade;s commitment to funding evidence-based health and education initiatives, there should be an equally strong commitment to making sure that we know if collaboration has any demonstrable effect on how these programs perform, and just what features of collaboration are associated with these outcomes. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Millions of federal dollars are scheduled to be spent on the nationwide dissemination of evidence based programs. These will be implemented by multi-agency collaboratives and public-private partnerships.

2760-4049	Limit government use of classified satellite data	2009-05-21 00:00:00	The Problem: In 2007, the Bush administration decided to allow more federal agencies to use data from intelligence satellites, i.e., classified data. Nearly all federal agencies these days use satellite imagery, but non-classified imagery is adequate to meet most non-intel needs based on my experience as a GIS specialist at a federal homeland security agency. To oversee the distribution of that data, the Bush administration proposed to establish a new government entity that included no external oversight of potential privacy violations resulting from the new policy.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Any benefit of access to classified imagery at federal departments and agencies like USDA, EPA and HHS is offset by the negative consequences of incorporating the secrecy apparatus that must accompany classified information. Over time, "public" agencies will be transformed into intelligence agencies.<br /><br />Use of classified data is particularly problematic in terms of the proposed use for disaster mapping at DHS (and virtually all other federal agencies). The public needs to know the extent of structure damage, the location of flooded roads and of damaged bridges following a disaster. But, if DHS uses classified imagery as the base for its disaster maps, that information would not be available except to government officials with clearances. It would not be available even to emergency responders, like fire, police and medical personnel, if they do not have clearances.<br /><br />Another negative consequence is the additional cost of security clearances for the thousands of employees that potentially would handle classified map data - an unjustified burden on US taxpayers.</div><br />	deep_harm	-6	18	24	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2760-4049

Happiness is a perception of one's own state of being, i.e. what makes me happy doesn't necessarily make you feel the same. Currently we have a government in the U.S. that, to us mostly laymen, seems like an unstoppable force. Whether you see it as a good force, or a bad force, a force it certainly is. A force that, currently, seems to thrive on the venom of vindictive action against an entity known as: "Terrorist". A terrorist is frankly, someone who causes a sense of terror to advance an agenda, i.e. 224 years ago when British colonist rebelled against their king, they too, where labeled terrorist. In this sense, any entity to attack a perceived enemy, is well, a terrorist. But that word carries some heavy weight, where does the wordâ&euro;&trade;s application stop? Just hearing the word brings up memories of 9/11, destruction & dismay, and a general sense of fear from the unknown. To those who the U.S. would deem terrorist, they see themselves as revolutionaries, martyrs, people who, in their eyes, are stopping a beast from invading their lands, their ideals, much as we would if presented with similar circumstance. Remember, people want happiness and comfort, and the majority will do what is needed to attain that goal and make it last. That is why most wars are fought, pure and simple. To obtain a state of happiness for one's self, a sense of security. For some rulers of history past this meant conquest for supreme power and to others the exact opposite through treaties for peace, but all outcomes where roughly the same. Eventually the fighting stopped and the ruling powers returned to their kingly affairs. Whether their interest was in their subjects or themselves, they no longer had to worry about a bordering state invading them and vice versa, instead they had a new source for free resources or they had a new trading partner, either way, both goals attempt to obtain comfort, stability, and a general sense of happiness.<br /><br />The Idea:<br />We need to move away from technological happiness, or as I view it, lulled comfort. While technology is an amazing, constantly evolving organism, it's application is severely limited due to it's effect on the environment and the masses. Why you may ask? Because a majority of technology relies too heavily on other factors i.e. electricity and other natural resources. Throughout history there have been searches to find perfect renewable resource such as the fabled Philosopher's stone, but all of these have turned up nothing. Nothing that could be generally applied. I purpose a co-existence with technology here in America. To where most people will equally know, for instance, the value of a home garden, or at least, have the ability to produce one if they so desired, next to knowledge of, say, what ABC has next fall for it's line up . The focus in this country should be how are we going to survive the next 100 years, not Mr. Obama or the next guy's term. General education of techniques that have been keeping people alive for the past 2,000 years, such as farming, building a shelter from the land, basic survival skills, etc. should be given serious consideration by state and federal governments and taught in public classes, for adults and children. Tax incentives should be given to folks who join up to teach. Now what if, but certainly hopefully not, something terrible happens, and as a result, our country breaks down, to the point where it is in utter chaos, such as the current situation in many areas of Iraq. What then? All those hours wasted with Grand Theft Auto and American Idol could have been used to further your own development. But don't get me wrong, entertainment is needed for our human mind, just in quantity. We need to find a balance between desire and necessity or else our future will not last that long if our only goals are the consumption of material goods to obtain a sense of "happiness". This is what addicts do, achieve that current "high", and then move to the next best thing. Our culture is very much in this addict mode, just look at how the media excitement is over new studio movies or a celebrity's new thing. These things embody what many people view as Happiness. We want to imagine, or romanticize about what it could be like if we were in the movie or if we were the celebrity. This is not reality, but a lulled state of being, to where one's cares leave the emotional realm and enter the material. A focus should be put on fellowship over ownership, Nature education over digital sedation. To learn survival skills and it's applications for the future can bring lasting happiness and security to any mind. To have the confidence to know that you have the skills at hand that at any moment, you could feed your family and not have to rely on loan notes we affectionately call money so you can go to a grocery store and buy what you could have harvested one's own self. Technology is not inherently evil, just widely misused, and now, is slowly numbing the populous to forget their roots and plan for their future. Move away from Facebook and put your face in a book on how to grow food, how to culture ground for use, or even how to paint, create, or to somehow further your life in anyway with the goal: for the good of all creatures of the Earth, because this will, of course, benefit mankind as a whole. Communal learning, cultural evolution, it's how people got to where we are today and what weâ&euro;&trade;ll need for tomorrow. The culture of America is becoming digital, it needs to return to the camp fire. We each have our part to bear in this life. What we do with it, in the end, only truly matters to the bearer.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The ability for the common man to produce their own food, shelter, and well being through education of the land and the nature of our world is most important. These survival skills should be basic for all people. What happens if the economy breaks down and the Internet goes poof? All contact would be gone, chaos would ensue, and the dark ages would most certainly return. People need to stop solely relying on man-made devices and take some power back for themselves. Be prepared and be ready to survive, cause really, in the end, it can only help us. </div><br />	gbtorsion	-25	6	31	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2767-4049

2769-4049	Information Sharing & Security	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Today's networks are so interconnected, it is becoming increasing difficult to define a network. Defending the information a network handles is even harder. Traditional methods are simply not able to keep up with the rapid growth of connectivity. New applications such as social networking have increased the complexity of information distribution across connected networks to the point that information cannot be protected by defending the hardware systems that handle the data.<br />A true cross-domain solution, one that protects data independent of hardware or distribution system and protects the data at all times, at rest or in transmission is critically needed for government operations.<br />This software solution must run in existing environments (UNIX, Linux, MS-Windows), requiring only everyday computing skills.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea is important because it advances information security to the next generation and enhances information sharing by building protection into the data itself.<br /><br />It is then possible to share privacy and classfied data regardless of the communication means.

2770-4049	Affirmative Obligation to Disclose	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Government should have an affirmative legal obligation to disclose information to the public in a timely manner, thereby expanding the presumption of openness. Our national public access laws are relatively recent in our history. Until 1966, with passage of FOIA, there really was no law giving the public any right to government information. For all its usefulness, FOIA is not a true right-to-know law. FOIA puts government in a passive role; the law is not triggered unless there is a public request. Under a national right-to-know law, the approach would be reversed. Federal agencies would have an affirmative obligation to disclose information, the public a passive role to review and use it. <br /><br />Agencies should be required to disclose newly collected electronic information holdings in a timely manner and justify in writing reasons for withholding information. Reasons for nondisclosure should be no more numerous than the current FOIA exemptions or responsibilities for national security classification.<br /><br />While it can be argued that this will put federal agencies on an endless treadmill, spending all their time making information publicly accessible instead of doing the work of the people, the reality is that it is increasingly easy to make electronic information - in all its formats - publicly accessible. Moreover, as discussed throughout this report, a functioning democracy requires an informed and active citizenry, which can be accelerated through affirmative dissemination of government information. Thus, this law would cover all information holdings - from spending information to regulatory actions to enforcement actions to directories of federal employees to e-mails to audio and video collections.<br /><br />- From the 21st Century RTK Agenda<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	21stCenturyRTK	72	83	11	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2770-4049

Many have been tortured. None of this is constitutional, moral, ethical, or consistent with American values. All of this is done in secrecy. The President has taken the Bush administration's policies even further by espousing the value of "prolonged detention" for possible crimes that might be committed, not what has been committed.

That is, have the government create team leaders in a way, of very specific bite sized initiatives. Then bring in unemployed American talent to work on these diverse teams. Example: Digitizing medical records in an area. You could put technical writer, trainers, designers to work in a given geographic location. The team lead would ensure a strategic direction and progress. Make it easy to draw upon the talents of the unemployed. It might not be a permanent job, but it would provide some income.

2778-4049	Release government-developed unclassified software as open source software, by default	2009-05-21 00:00:00	By default, unclassified software which the government paid to develop should be released to the public as open source software (unless there's a good reason not to).<br /><br />I'm sure there will need to be exceptions. There would need to be some sort of guidelines to figure out when to grant those exceptions, and those guidelines should be developed though lively discussion. Most obviously, if it's a special ingredient necessary for national security, then it should be classified and not revealed in any form. Export controls would also apply. But the exceptions should be that: Exceptions.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>If "we the people" paid to develop it, then "we the people" should get it! I think this idea fits into the good government ideal of data transparency; after all, software is data. Currently, we have a lot of waste and unnecessary costs due to loss, re-development, and/or government-created monopolies. The government is not a venture capitalist (VC); people who need a VC should go to a VC.<br /><br />I think this idea easily fits into the broader ideas of transparency and open government, including the Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government. Indeed, there's a long history of U.S. laws specifically set up to make data available. Most obviously, Freedom on information act (FOIA) requests make it possible to extract information from the U.S. government. 17 USC 105 and 17 USC 101 prevents the U.S. government from claiming U.S. copyright on a work "prepared by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of that person's official duties". So this idea would be an extension of what's already gone on.<br /><br />Think of all the advantages if software developed by U.S.-funded research could be reused by other research projects and commercial firms. For example, imagine if other researchers could simply extend previous work by modifying previously-developed software, instead of re-building yet another version from scratch. Anyone could take commercialize the research making it more likely that it would be commercialized instead of being lost in the archives shown at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Some argue that giving sole rights is the only way to commercialization, but that's just not true; open source software is commercial software, so this is simply a different and fairer path to commercialization. In contrast, the current system inhibits all kinds of technical progress; Biere's "The Evolution from LIMMAT to NANOSAT" (Apr 2004) found that "important details are often omitted in [research] publications and can only be extracted from source code... [Making source code available] is as important to the advancement of the field as publications".<br /><br />If this happened, I envision a two-stage process: (1) release of the software as an archive (so it can be downloaded), and (2) some of it will get picked up and used to start an active OSS project. The second stage might not happen for many years after the first, and that's okay. Some will ask "how will people find it", but I think that's the wrong question. There are many commercial search engines that can find code, but they can only find stuff that's web-accessible; let's give them something to find.<br /></div><br />	dwheeler	82	96	14	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2778-4049

This could be done through regular meetings, on-line information, succinct Q&A; sheets, or pre-recorded webinars. People cannot take their place as equals without it.<br /><br />The flip side is that government doesn't have basic information or relationships with its constituents. It doesn't know how to engage people and with whom to begin. Community groups could have regular meetings, on-line information, and pre-recorded webinars introducing public employees to their communities, cultural courtesies, and best ways to engage with them. Basics of respectful communication etc. Government cannot effectively listen and "be" with people without it.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>A major barrier to participation is not just access but relationships, knowledge, capacity - a way of prepare people to take a place at the table. For example this site itself doesn't have an easy link to find out how to do anything - it assumes familiarity that just does not exist among most people. A simple "The basics of this site" would ensure participation by people other than those who already are doing so.<br /><br />I conducted a planning process that engaged 10,000 residents in Ramsey County, MN. We found that those who had an orientation session before the process felt much better about their own ability to influence than did those who did not. I work with hundreds of organizations- both government and nonprofit. It is not a lack of desire that keeps people out. It is a lack of understanding and relationships across the boundaries.

2789-4049	Give Citizens a Simple Checklist for Rating "Public Engagement"	2009-05-21 00:00:00	When I attend a meeting that is supposed to involve some type of "public engagement", it would be nice to have a simple checklist that I could use to rate whether that meeting really was Transparent, Participatory, and Collaborative.<br /><br />This simple checklist could be the standard tool for citizens to provide feedback to government agencies about the quality of their public engagement activities. In fact, the requirement for federal department and agencies to "solicit public feedback" about their public engagement is mentioned three (3) times in President Obama's Memorandum on Transparent and Open Government.<br /><br />The checklist could contain simple "Yes/No" questions, along these lines:<br /><br />"Was it Transparent?"<br /><br />--> At some public meetings, it is not clear what is being discussed. Even if the meeting's agenda is available, the actual proposal or other documents being discussed are not made available to the public.<br />[Transparent? Check "No".]<br /><br />"Was it Participatory?"<br /><br />--> At some public meetings, members of the public are allowed to attend, but are not given an opportunity to ask questions and comment on the proposal being discussed.<br />[Participatory? Check "No".]<br /><br />"Was it Collaborative?"<br /><br />--> Even when a public meeting allows for public *feedback* on a proposal, it may have skipped over the step for public *input* could have shaped the proposal differently.<br />[Collaborative? Check "No".]<br /><br />Of course, different citizens can have different judgements about the very same meeting. But, just like a "customer survey", a review of the collected checklists should provide some objective evidence about the quality of public engagement.<br /><br />ALSO, this standard checklist should be developed and promoted by government agencies - now - in order to gauge their current effort *before* they attempt improvements. Otherwise, they won't know - later on - if they are doing any better. (You know: it's like weighing yourself *before* the diet.)<br /><br />[NOTE: The League of Women Voters (LWV) have some local chapters with an "Observer Corps" that use checklists to rate public meetings. However, different chapters have developed different formats. The LWV's experience would be helpful in creating a federal checklist for "citizen observers".]<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Citizens need a clear and simple way (i.e., a checklist) to let government officials know whether "public engagement" is working. <br /><br /><br /><br />It will NOT be simple and clear to citizens if different government departments and agencies create a plethora of ways for citizens to judge their success regarding "public engagement".<br /><br /><br /><br />respectfully,<br /><br />Stephen Buckley<br /><br />www.UStransparency.com</div><br />	Stephen Buckley	57	62	5	6	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2789-4049

2792-4049	Real penalties for agencies that violate FOIA time limits	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Congress has set time limits for agencies to respond to FOIA requests, but many agencies deliberately flaunt these limits by failing to fund their FOIA offices, building up multi-year backlogs that serve the agency's desire to keep its operations secret. The courts let the agencies get away with it under a theory that they're doing the best they can. The FBI and NSA are two egregious exploiters, each of which lets FOIA requests languish for literally YEARS.<br /><br />Some or all of the suggestions below should be adopted to cure this problem.<br /><br />The President should penalize the following year's operating budget of any agency that has a backlog of FOIA requests, proportionately to its backlog. If the agency can't properly inform the public about its operations, it should be cut back to have fewer operations.<br /><br />If a FOIA request has not been responded to within the statutory deadline, the agency should be prohibited (by Executive Order and/or statute) from withholding any portion<br />of the records under "discretionary" authority. In other words, if a statute doesn't require the agency to withhold the info, the agency would be required to release it.<br />They can spend the time to make discretionary withholdings if they do it within the time limits; not after.<br /><br />Any agency that violates the FOIA time limits in more than 10% of its FOIA requests should be unable to penalize citizens for violating agency-imposed time limits in any other matter before the agency.<br /><br />No fees should be charged to requesters for any FOIA request which is not answered within the statutory time limits.<br /><br />Congress should authorize the courts to hold agency heads in contempt of court for failing to meet FOIA time limits in an individual request. This authority should include the court's ability to place the agency head, attorney, or other appropriate government employees, under arrest by US Marshals until such time as the FOIA request is satisfied. Courts would have discretion to do this at any time after the request is overdue, but would not be required to exert this authority until the request has been delayed by more than 10x the statutory period.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Agencies violate time limits at will, and are never penalized. But they penalize requesters (and other citizens) all the time for failing to meet agency-imposed time limits.</div><br />	gnu	44	57	13	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2792-4049

If you don't reply, we will pretend you never filed this FOIA request." This lets them sneakily evade requests.<br /><br />It's fine for agencies to ask requesters if they'd like to voluntarily cancel their FOIA requests. What isn't fine is for agencies to cancel the requests without ever hearing from the requester. If the agency gets no response to its inquiry, it should continue processing the FOIA request.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Requests shouldn't get canceled because the requester went on vacation or was otherwise too busy to respond to the agency.

2795-4049	Stop agencies from "railroading" regulations under APA	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Agencies that wish to impose or modify regulations are currently required to publish them "for notice and comment" in the Federal Register, accept comments for several months, modify the regs based on the comments, and only then promulgate them as "final" regulations. (There are exceptions for emergencies.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, many agencies get a fixed idea in their heads about what they want to do, and then ignore the public comments, promulgating something that large numbers of responders object to. Homeland Security is notorious for this, getting many thousands of citizens publicly opposing some of its regulations, which were adopted anyway, virtually unchanged.<br /><br />If an agency gets twice as many negative as positive comments, it should be unable to adopt the regulation, or any regulation similar to the proposed regulation, until it proposes a new regulation which gets enough positive comments or few enough negative comments to meet this standard.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The notice and comment process currently depends on the good faith of the agency involved. When that agency tries to railroad an unpopular policy that gets insignificant public support, it should be unable to do so.<br /><br />Citizens won't bother to participate in public notice-and-comment processes if their input is regularly ignored. Of course, this is what the agency wants -- total control with no citizen oversight. Thus the law, or Executive Orders, must deny the agency that capability. When the citizens say "No!" loud and clear, the agency must listen.</div><br />	gnu	12	20	8	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2795-4049

There should be NO people who fall into that category!

2800-4049	Issue directive making federal disaster maps and data public	2009-05-21 00:00:00	In recent disasters, such as the California wildfires, there were no publicly available computerized maps and data. At one point, state and local responders were relying on maps posted to Google maps by a local newspaper.<br /><br />FEMA customarily prepares computerized maps (GIS), but does not customarily release that data. It sometimes makes the data available to researchers and, nonpublicly, to other government agencies. But, there appears to be no set policy making the data reliably available to the public. Other federal agencies, such as the Department of Agriculture, can be even more reluctant to release data. This deprives the public of access to information useful in many respects, from filing insurance claims, assessing the adequacy of emergency response, planning routes of travel around affected area, even lifesaving evacuations, as in the California wildfires.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The data collected by federal agencies for disaster related activities belongs to the public and should be accessible to them.</div><br />	lewisplan	47	52	5	5	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2800-4049	
2801-4049	Repairing the regulatory damage from the Bush era 	2009-05-21 00:00:00	For the eight years of the Bush administration, the political appointees in the departments and agencies were tasked with creating an enduring legacy of rules that benefit commercial interests over the public interest. Which was to be expected, when James Watts' alcolytes ran Interior, and former pesticide lobbyists were making policy regarding pesticide regulation. That was part of the general pattern of placing people in agencies and departments who were fundamentally opposed to their missions as set by law, or who actively supported the interests of the industries they were supposedly regulating, and expected to work for them (again) after leaving their government posts.<br /><br />The result is a toxic legacy of regulations that require thorough review and revision, to restore their rightful function of protecting the environment and the public interest.<br /><br />How best to do that? One might just start reading CFR (Code of Federal Regulation) Sections, and flag any that seem problematic. But, that is not a practical approach, given that EPA's Title 40, alone, contains over 18,000 separate sections and nearly 1.5 million lines of text.<br /><br />Instead, it would be far preferable to use available tools to do automated searches to find the changes made during the Bush administration, review those changes to rank them according to the degree of harm they are causing, then initiate the revision process where needed.<br /><br />An initial version of process has been applied to Title 33 (Army Corps) and Title 40 (EPA). The end result is that changes are displayed side-by-side, color-highlighted, in HTML pages viewable by any browser. For one example, see 33CFR323, that was revised to make it easy for the Army Corps to approve mountaintop removal mining operations: http://restoringsanity.org/cfr/2000_2007_diffs/33/33cfr323_diff_mod.html<br /><br />With only a couple of days of time to set up and "fine-tune" the process for Title 40, a few minutes of text crunching immediately showed that 7,500 of the over 12,000 Sections in common between the 2000 and 2008 versions had zero changes in the text, and could be excluded from the initial review. Another 1,900 Sections had 10 or fewer lines with apparent changes, and likely did not include any substantive changes. The time and cost savings of that approach should be quite obvious, even for subject-matter-specific reviews of regulations. Atrazine, for example, is referred to in 24 separate CFR Sections of Title 40 and Title 21.<br /><br />The same process could be applied to any (all) CFR sections, and the results placed in a generally accessible location. See, for example, Title 40, at http://restoringsanity.org/cfr/2000_2008_diffs/40/. Reviewers within a given agency would have easy access to the diff files, regardless of their location. Also, open government goals are advanced, because the review process can include both cross-agency participation in the case of overlapping jurisdiction, and public participation by stakeholders and subject matter experts outside of government.<br /><br />The above approach solves the problem of universal availability of the rules for review by any interested party. The remaining non-trivial task is to set up the tools that allow all reviewers to provide input to those who are responsible for initiating and effecting any changes to the rules.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Deleterious changes were made throughout the Code of Federal Regulations during the eight years of the Bush administration. The proposed automated process can find and display those changes for review by all interested parties within and outside the government, and would save many tens of thousands of hours that would otherwise be required for simply finding those changes.</div><br />	dsfinley	9	23	14	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2801-4049	
2802-4049	Halt proliferation of classified data among agencies	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Keeping agencies open and accessible to the public is thwarted when there is a proliferation of classified data that is distributed widely among government agencies and offices even when it is not essential to their programs. Using even one bit of classified data in an agency work product (say a classified satellite photo on which unclassified data are displayed) makes the final product unavailable to the public even though it might be important for the public to see. proliferation of classified data also generates a need for more employees with security clearances and creates a culture of withholding information even when it is not classified. Along with clearances, agencies handling classified data have to have SCIFs, secure technology and a host of bureaucratic procedures. When the executive branch considers sharing data, such as classified satellite data, with non-intelligence agencies, there should be a process that ensures public access is not lost for minimal information gain.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	deep_harm	2	16	14	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2802-4049	
2803-4049	Make emergency planning a bottom-up process	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Federal agencies typically write national emergency plans and only later obtain public comment. Often, the public is hindered in commenting because they have not been educated about the basics of emergency planning and coordination. Develop a one-semester emergency planning curriculum that schools can present to high school students (with input from state and local planners) that introduces basic concepts of individual, business AND government emergency response and planning so that they can see how all of the pieces fit together and become familiar with basic terminology. This will produce a generation of citizens who can confidently participate in public discussions of disaster planning and preparedness, and more apt to prepare plans for their families and businesses. With more public participation, government plans will become more responsive to the real needs of citizens and not to what bureaucrats think they need.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Through the history of disaster response, government emergency plans have repeatedly failed and the recovery process frequently fails society's most vulnerable. This, I believe, is the result of a disconnect between those who with the power and resources to meet the needs of disaster-striken citizens and the citizens, who are unable to effectively communicate their needs.</div><br />	lewisplan	29	36	7	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2803-4049

Such documents are treated as more classified than classified documents, because there are no public or agency guidelines for when this label can be applied, no process of appeal from this classification, and no court can order such things released. The label is completely at the discretion of the head of TSA, yet it has statutory force to withhold such documents from the public.<br /><br />An Executive Order should merge the SSI system into the Classified system such that it has clear standards which are reviewable by courts; cannot be used to cover up agency crimes or malfeasance; cannot be used to create "secret laws" that affect the public; etc.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Agency employees cannot classify documents (e.g. as SECRET) unless they actually meet published criteria, and judges can review the documents and declassify ones that don't meet the standards.

2814-4049	Community Social Service Summit	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Oregon has developed a unique approach to Social Services and Health Care for Seniors, Disabled, and those in poverty. It is a fundamental belief that communities are in a much better position to determine and provide these services - Portland social service needs are not the same as Molalla social service needs. The Community-Based approach includes the recent Community Congress held in Clackamas County to advise the County Board of Commissioners regarding community priorities and concerns. It also includes the forthcoming (May 28, 2009) Community Social Service Summit in Molalla, Oregon to inventory and coordinate local social services by volunteer, community service, 501(c)3, faith-based, and other organizations. And finally, it includes Oregon Project Independence (O.P.I.). This video captures the essence of how this approach may substantially reduce government costs - perhaps even applied nationally: <object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/itjTCrl5pss"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/itjTCrl5pss" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This proposal is critically important in coordinating the provision of social services and healthcare at a community level. It's imperative that community services be inventoried in order to monitor to avoid abuse and redundancy. Government social services are well-intentioned but unsustainable, do not address community-specific needs, and are too convoluted.</div><br />	jim	23	30	7	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2814-4049

2819-4049	Open Up Presidential Debates to Third Parties	2009-05-21 00:00:00	For far too long in this country, politics (and debates in general) has been run by the two major parties - Democrats and Republicans. While both of these parties are close to the center of the political spectrum and represent a lot of people, there are others out there with other ideas. Yes, we have third parties, but they haven't won an election (or even been competitive) in decades. Part of the reason they aren't more competitive is that no one knows about them. People in this country have grown up know Republicans and Democrats.. and if you're not one of those two, you don't really matter. If you want to vote, you pretty much have to choose the lesser of two evils.<br /><br />Also, third parties are very hard to get started. The third party laws in many states are so insane they are nearly impossible (but that's a different issue). If third parties were allowed to contribute to televised national debates, awareness would drastically increase. Instead of being forced to choose the lesser of two evils, people would actually have a broadly publicized candidate for whom to vote.<br /><br />In the end, the issue comes down to equality. We say we're ALL equal, but then we turn around and say if you're not a Democrat or Republican, you're screwed. Open up the process and make it easier for third parties to participate!<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Would dramatically increase voter turnout, interest, and participation; would reduce the partisanship of many elections</div><br />	dudemanfellabra	110	125	15	12	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2819-4049

2821-4049	Constitution Discussion Groups	2009-05-21 00:00:00	As a student of the U.S. Constitution and its history, I recently decided to hold discussion groups in my home every other week, on the subject of Constitutional theory and history. It has been enlightening to observe people who had never read the Constitution learn for the first time about concepts like "Sovereignty of the People" and "protection of rights through limitation of powers." Their reactions to laws of questionable constitutionality currently on the books have demonstrated to me that a Constitutionally schooled electorate is a no nonsense electorate. It's clear we would all be better off if we all understood the U.S. Constitution.<br /><br />We need to bring friends and neighbors together, in person, to learn about the timeless and fundamental interests our Constitution codifies. Whether and how government should assist the people in this effort is an open matter, worthy of discussion. One thing that would help is READ THE BILL -- permitting the public to read bills, and screen provisions for Constitutionality, before bills are voted on. Any other devices that would help take the pain out of comparing laws Congress makes to the Supreme Laws Congress is supposed to obey, would be helpful.<br /><br />In any case, it is necessary for Americans to buckle down and study the Constitution, together, in person. There is no substitute for face to face discussion, although online discussion has its place.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Educating ourselves in Constitutional basics is important because representative democracy works properly if, and only if, an enlightened and engaged electorate enforces Constitutional principles at the polls. Representative democracy fails when, and always when, a faction overpowers public wisdom, decency, and resolve. Read Madison's Federalist No. 10 to understand that we cannot afford Constitutional ignorance. Yet how many Americans could today recite the first subject and verb of the Founding Document? <br /><br /><br /><br />In the aftermath of the Bush years, I have decided I have to do something to help my fellow citizens understand the dangers of Constitutional ignorance, and the security and confidence that flows from Constitutional knowledge.<br /><br /><br /><br />I will launch a website soon, called ByOurConsent.org, which I hope will become a nationwide springboard for neighborhood discusssion groups on Constitutional issues. I will be hosting discussion groups online very soon using www.gotomeeting.com conference software, which is free and easy to use. If you would like to participate, feel free to contact me by email at e.b.ledford@gmail.com.

2823-4049	Require agencies to change their falsehoods under the "Information Quality Act"	2009-05-21 00:00:00	Congress passed the Information Quality Act to require government agencies to tell the truth, and to respond and correct their facts when citizens point out falsehoods.<br /><br />But agencies get stuck in their lies and decline to follow this law. In particular, there's a current court case against HHS regarding whether marijuana has any legitimate use in medicine. The agency has argued to the court that despite the Act, they have no obligation to revise facts that they publish, and that citizens have no standing to take an agency to court to make it correct its lies. The District Court bought this argument; the case is now in the 9th Circuit.<br /><br />See: http://www.safeaccessnow.org/section.php?id=160<br />And: http://www.safeaccessnow.org/downloads/HHS%20Brief%20for%20Appellees%20.pdf<br /><br />The Obama administration should by Executive Order require agencies to correct their falsehoods, and to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts and the standing of requesters in doing so. And if the courts determine that the IQA does not provide sufficient jurisdiction for a lawsuit, it should be revised by Congress to have enough teeth that lying agencies can be brought, kicking and screaming, to the truth.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Obama claims that his administration's policies will be based on truth, not falsehood; and on sound science. The agencies currently make a mockery of this, denying knowledgeable citizens the tools to force agencies to retract their false statements, publish the truth, and base their policies and rulemaking on the truth.<br /><br />Thirteen states make marijuana legal as a medicine. Many hundreds of thousands of patients are using it today, under the care of tens of thousands of doctors. Yet HHS, FDA and DEA all persist in claiming there is "no accepted medical use" of marijuana. Close to 70% of the public accepts marijuana as a useful medicine, both in polls and when they have a chance to vote to make it legal (63% in Nov 2008 in Michigan). This is one of the more blatant examples of federal policies that are for political reasons deliberately and systematically based on a long-standing falsehood. Obama should not let it stay that way.</div><br />	gnu	15	27	12	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2823-4049

OMB and its many tools, which I do not enumerate here, have been used to put a gag on agencies and their employees, change the decisions of agencies, and impose presidential preferences on agencies in ways that frustrate congressional intent. Shouldn't the public know when agents of the president are imposing their will on public servants in agencies?<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>OMB can be used well by the White House.

2827-4049	expose all forms of executive branch and presidential "earmarking"	2009-05-22 00:00:00	Earmarking of funds by the president and the executive branch is substantially hidden from view, compared to earmarking by Congress. This occurs in grants, contracts, and the use of discretion during budget execution. We need statutory changes that open up these decision making processes to scrutiny, to ensure presidents, political appointees, and career civil servants are actually making decisions on non-political "merits" that can be scrutinized by the public, in order to keep the "merits" that presidents, political appointees, and civil servants actually use as non-political as we can.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Presidents and political appointees are political creatures too. Earmarking is not just a congressional behavior.</div><br />	jonathanhansen2001	39	46	7	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2827-4049	
2828-4049	open up agency specification of goals, objectives, and evaluation criteria	2009-05-22 00:00:00	The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requires agencies to create strategic plans that include mission statements, general goals and objectives, performance goals, and planned program evaluations. The law also requires annual performance plans to be created that contain performance goals and performance indicators. Agencies are required to consult with Congress and stakeholders about strategic plans. There is no requirement that agencies consult with Congress and stakeholders about performance indicators. But these things are used as barometers and definitions of "success." OMB and agencies should be required to publish draft mission statements, goals, measures, evaluation plans, and evaluation criteria for judging "success" in the Federal Register for public notice and comment. OMB and agencies should be required to respond to this feedback. Some idiots will respond, of course, but many serious groups, including interest groups, will have serious responses. Because goals and metrics guide agency activities and are used as a basis, ultimately, for appraising the peformance of federal employees, OMB and agencies need scrutiny in how they use discretion under law to set goals and pursue them. Otherwise, the president and political appointees enjoy tremendous power over career civil servants and get to impose their preferences, which oftentimes can frustrate congressional intent. OMB and agencies should also have open hearings to discuss these matters with the public.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This is a no brainer. </div><br />	jonathanhansen2001	32	36	4	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2828-4049

2830-4049	Insourcing Body Shop Jobs	2009-05-22 00:00:00	Insource government jobs currently performed by "body shop" contractors. This will save the government 10's of billions a year. Pay the worker a little bit more and get rid of the zero value add "body shop" company / contract.<br /><br />This idea goes hand-in-hand with streamlining the government's hiring practices. These civil servant exams are great, but if you are looking for an Electrical Engineer or a Computer Programmer, just take a resume and hire the guy! You do it anyway with the body shops and pay twice as much.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>I've worked in the D.C. area for a while. And what I find appaling is the amount of government workers whose jobs have been outsourced to body shops for pure profit. This "outsourcing" was a Bush initiative meant to make government run like a business. But all it did was make individuals and companies rich off of the taxpayers without any added value or benefit. All of sudden you have body shop companies that provide no value, yet are taking profit and overhead on an employee that has a desk at an agency performing the job of a government employee.<br /><br /><br /><br />For some agencies, the percentage of outsourced employees is outrageous. Some three letter agencies have 85% of employees outsourced. How is it better for national security to have a person have two desks, two phones and two computers - one in a secure facility and another in a non-secure facility?<br /><br /><br /><br />The most outrageous is the outsourcing of the govt's role on FCS. This definitely cost the tax payer billions - but politically speaking was a necessary consolidation prize for the losing bidder of FCS, the Boeing corporation.

2834-4049	American Civic Enrichment Policy	2009-05-22 00:00:00	The idea I propose is a theoretical concept that will cultivate a greater potential in the product of fiscal policy on the domestic front. As it stands today the prolific divergence of political perspectives has become agressively corrosive in our society. For three decades I have observed the institution of government on all levels in America has become trapped in a decadent vortex spinning ever closer towards a state of anarchy. The efficacy of governement is grossly deficient in the minds of most American citizens. The biased-media, political partisans, and special interest groups have disenfranchised the consensus of the nations citizens. The often irrational and illogical actions of groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association have sabbotaged our democracy with propaganda, an epic campaign of malicious litigation, and unethical conduct under an ugly mask of constitutional misinterpretation. <br />I believe that a process be designed and a channel established for citizens to specifically appropriate the spending of a reasonable portion of thier taxes. Instead of government being the absolute authority in spending taxes allow individuals to designate how thier contributions are spend within the parameters established by Congress. Allow individual Americans to decide prioriities in funding projects for the AmeriCorp, the Peace Corp, the National Endowment for the Arts, scientific and medical research. There is a program called the Combined Federal Campaign that I contributed to as a soldier that would serve a a good format to implement a process like this. Each year a pamphlet is generated explaining thousands of different charitible organizations eligible to recieve a fraction of my contribution. I made the call as to what specific charity would recieve the percentage of a total that I deemed fit.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>I believe this idea would revive American trust in the political process and institutions of government.

The emergence of "Too big to fail" corporations such as AIG are a sign that this is an unhealthy economic stance to take.<br /><br />In fact, our current monetary system was shown by the now-deceased engineer and author Robert Heinlein decades ago to be unsustainable and mathematically flawed. (The current economic crisis is evidence of this.) <br /><br />Heinlein suggested a much more mathematically sound and reliable system in his novel "For Us, The Living". The system, summarized, is as follows:<br /><br />1. Control of printing legal tender is taken away from the Federal Reserve (as it is too closely tied to the private banking industry), and is turned over to a government-only agency with complete transparency, and complete independence from the banking industry.<br /><br />2. Remove the system by which banks can take in one dollar and lend out 10 from it. Banks should lend money only as they have it.<br /><br />3. Instead of being an unreliable loan & debt based system, the basis of value for the new currency would be an economic standard. (Basically, each dollar is backed by 'a portion of U.S. product and economy'.)<br /><br />4. The government prints this money based purely on the increase of overall American product. (For example: If there are three cars made, and two break, the government prints the money to buy one car. This ensures there is always enough money to buy all products, but not enough to devalue the money, as the money from previous cars is still floating around.)<br /><br />5. The government, from this printed money, funds itself. (Theoretically, this can completely remove the need for taxes altogether.)<br /><br />6. (This step is highly important) The excess is spread evenly among the entire American population. (Every American, every month, would receive a 'heritage check', collecting on benefits of their combined labor overall.) The main benefit to this is this works as a constant stimulus, encouraging more economy, basically providing a positive feedback loop in the economy. Mathematically, it points to an extremely healthy, stable, maintainable, economy and government with a much more transparent economic system.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>As it currently is, the financial system of the United States is convoluted and tricky, to say the least.</div><br />	joshupetersen	-11	15	26	7	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2845-4049	
2846-4049	Democracy Booster	2009-05-22 00:00:00	Imagine people could make a living from their ideas and shape their state enhancing what is important to them. <br /><br />Imagine the state would pay 10 cent per citizen who would, what I call, execute an action. Where as every citizen is limited to one action a day with the possibility to cumulate a maximum of 20 actions to allow reasonable buffering if a person is unavailable for some reason. <br /><br />Imagine that the citizen will use this one action to either vote on, what I call, a thread or use the action to himself start a thread. <br /><br />Imagine that when the citizen votes for a thread the submitter of the thread receives 8 cent out of the 10 cent. If the vote applies to a comment the submitter of the thread and the submitter of the comment share the 8 cent between each other. This only if the vote is a positive one. If the vote is negative the 8 cent go to a charity organization, a school, social or e.g. healthcare institution which is chosen out of a list by the person committing the action. The remaining 2 cent are thought to finance the IT-related requirements to run the system. <br /><br />Imagine a state giving back 10 cent a day to every citizen to enable a nation wide cluster of thought. <br /><br />Imagine a system that would pay a good idea every day and help the needing when things go negative. <br /><br />Imagine how fast and efficient this would be, how easy language barriers could be overcome and common sense established. <br /><br />Imagine we can, because we do.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It will solve problems in a fast, democratic and transparent manner.

2847-4049	Monitoring how my house or senate rep voted on current or past issues that I care for	2009-05-22 00:00:00	The idea: Have a small computer application developed similar to weather or stock report monitor that runs in the system tray that would constantly monitor voting statistics from the house and the senate. This application could be personalized by selecting your congressman and senators by entering your zipcode. It would also allow you on the ongoing basis to select the important issues (important issues for you) from the house and the senate calendar (and marking which result you're hoping for) and soon after the vote results are available, it would popup a window with the voting result plus how your own house or senate rep voted on the issue that's important to you. You could also have an option to do a quick statistics on how your house and senate reps voted on the important issues in the last 12-24 months.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea is important because it would help you to see how well you and your principles are represented by your congressman and senators looking back a year or two and decide whether you will vote for them again.<br />I've been chewing on this idea for a long time, everyone should consider it as a basic, raw idea and I hope that if more folks pitch in, it can evolve into a really great tool.</div><br />	geza	99	107	8	6	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2847-4049

2850-4049	Freedom of the press cannot be full access for the press...	2009-05-22 00:00:00	Freedom of the press as I understand it was supposed to guarantee free punblic speech on issues, especially where there may be a perceived failure of government policy. Unfortunately, no one is holding the press accountable for its policies and tactics, and failure to report the facts accurately and consistently throughout coverage of a story. When I watch the major news channels, they invariably make an initial mention of an issue by using a highly biased, even misleading catch phrase. Also as a matter of routine, they discuss all sorts of opinions about what may or may not have happened, conveniently omitting the facts concerning the key point(s) the story revolves around or hinges on. They think this is how you bait and keep viewer interest. Its like they are saying the childhood taunt, "Nanny, nanny, nanny, I know and you don't!" Since we have laws requiring truth in advertising, we need laws requiring accuracy and full disclosure by news organizations. They are given White House Press conferences, and other access the public does not get, then they pick and choose what to tell the public, and how to present it.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>As long as we allow the press to sensationalize (A.K.A. inciting a riot?) the news, and put there own bias on stories (lie?) through how the story is presented, we will continue to have ignorant voters elect ignorant imbeciles.

2851-4049	Adopt Systems Thinking as a Key Approach to Policy and Practice Making in Governance	2009-05-22 00:00:00	<br /><br />We need closer integration between departments/agencies/levels of government towards problem solving. Government across many parts of the world is formed in hierarchical, topical silos/fiefdoms that prevent the cross fertilisation of needs, ideas, expertise and budgets. But the operation of our planet and communities are based on integrated systems, making likely and unlikely interconnections. Governments and societies would benefit by learning to think, organise, spend and behave in conjucture with these systems. Transparent information is a huge step forward. Systems Thinking is a valuable way of organising and understanding information and transforming it into patterns, maps, policies and plans, verbally, visually and functionally.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Many of our 21st century problems stem from this unsustainable, Cartesian model. Climate change is a good example of what happens when we isolate areas of scientific research and understanding from energy policy, economic policy, societal well being, international tariffs and trade agreements, etc.</div><br />	courtney.peyton	35	37	2	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2851-4049	
2854-4049	Provide complete information to voters	2009-05-22 00:00:00	In California, voters are mailed an extensive packet before each election, which includes the full text of any ballot proposals, pro & con debates prepared by each side, and official statements from every candidate running for office in your district, from judges to the drain commissioner. Each party that is registered in your district also includes a statement of their core principles. <br />This packet is amazing - free to the public, readily available, exhaustive in its content. I used to make notes and take it with me to the polls. Imagine my surprise when I learned that in my new state of Michigan, I cannot even find accurate predictions about the smaller items that will be on my ballot, much less any information on the candidates or where they stand. <br />Why does this only happen in California? EVERY voter should have ready access to basic information on every local candidate and issue, in order to make an informed choice at the polls. We could do something like this on a national level, providing the format and funding, but including local information for each district. Information should be standardized to make it easier to compare across candidates and it should be publicly distributed. It could be online, and local districts could choose to have print versions mailed to voters. <br />Voter education should not be a scavenger hunt. Every voter has the right to know what is going to be on the ballot before they get there, and should have the time to review the most relevant facts and arguments.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea is important because voting is the most powerful tool citizens possess. It is the foundation for all participation in government. Yet without a formal structure for disseminating information on local candidates and proposals, even this basic level of participation is inaccessible to many.</div><br />	joliev	14	24	10	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2854-4049

2856-4049	Wanted: Fresh Thinking and New Ideas 	2009-05-22 00:00:00	If government is really wanting to implement innovative ideas the first step would be to look at hiring and recruitment (as well as training and development practices). In my home state for example, a person advances in government based a lot on who they know and some of what they know. This has become a problem because people who worked in government 20+ years and have retired are being re-hired and implementing the same old ideas while employees with new ideas are overlooked for promotions and often belittled for daring to think out of the box. And yes, said workers are receiving both retirement checks and paychecks.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea is important because by working to break up the good old boy networks you will be opening up job opportunities for individuals in need of work and thus lowering unemployment, increasing innovative thinking and stimulating the economy by putting more people to work in good jobs.</div><br />	espalding_bbr	20	22	2	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2856-4049	
2857-4049	MAJOR CHANGES REQUIRED IN YOUR FOREIGN POLICY FOR INTERFERING OTHER COUNTRIES ACTIVITIES 	2009-05-22 00:00:00	Dear Mr.President,<br /><br />Good Day ! <br /><br />First of all I would like to thank you for giving chance to participate in your blogs for giving the idea for making open policy. I am an Indian, resident of United Arab Emirates(U.A.E.)morethan 14 years. I would like to recommend the following changes which would be beneficial to your country as well as your people.<br /><br /><br />1. Cut down the military funds for mobilization of troops otherthan your country. <br /><br />2. Give more power to UN and NATO jointly to interfere other countries activities instead of your country's direct involvement in order to stable other countries civil war or war between countries. Of course your country can help to other country according to the request of UN/NATO and they must pay for that once the country made stable. The same funds can be utlized for the needy countries for childrens education and food programme.<br /><br />By way of doing the above your country's tax payers will be satisfied as they are giving the money for the development of their own country.<br /><br />3. Reduce the employees tax and collect more from the corporate side.<br /><br />4. Withdraw all your troops from various countries and keep in your country to protect for internal security ofyour country as and when required. Since, currently some countries/individual group exepect/wants to disturb your economy by way of spending huge amount for military operation in various countries. <br /><br />5. Invite more migrant wherever not developed the area. So that it will be helpful your country to develop in various state which would boost your economy. Of course by considering the country's protect ofimmigration law.<br /><br />I mean to say some areas (where your country's people doesn't like) can develop with the help of unskilled/skilled workers of other countries,if you reduce the step of migration.<br /><br />6. Your country's people should not exceed a certain limit of investment to other countries similar to UAE Policy, in order to reduce the outflow of your country's funds. The same time attract more investment and business oppoprtunities in retail section morethan the corporate level. So that your economy will always stable.<br /><br />Reduce the depedency of the huge corporate firms and increase more semi larger size companies with giving a lot of attractive tax schemes. So that the company's bankruptcy will not effect much worst then ever seen in your country's few larger firm. <br /><br />7. We all believe that you know others difficulties since you have already came accross these areas in your life. It means that surely you can deliver the result according to the expectation of your countries people (as common people).<br /><br />Wish you all the best.<br /><br />With best regards, <br /><br />Mullassery Kunjumon Rajmohan (Internal Auditor- Dubai based Group of Companies) <br />P.O.Box 7851, Dubai, U.A.E.<br />Mobile :+97150 6571663<br />Residence Tel : +9714 8850085<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The above will encourage the common people of your countries when they pay the tax and the utlization of their tax for your countries benefits. <br /><br /><br /><br />General Notes.<br /><br /><br /><br />I am interested to participate/give more ideas in various field,once i got feedback from your office regarding the above points.

2858-4049	Outlaw the two-party system...	2009-05-22 00:00:00	The only forms of government inherently more perilous than the two party dominated system are dictators, and monarchies. That doesn't say much in the way of good news or promise for a bright future. Since I would be King, let's make the Republican and Democratic parties illegal and start over with a policy and idea based electoral system. The reality is that more persons are registered as Independents (such as myself) than either Rep. or Dem., so there is consederable dissatisfaction with the record of the two party system. If we also consider how many people have simply stopped participating, in reality we have 'proclamation without representation,' something our nation's founders were trying to correct/irradicate.<br /><br />We could start by developing a series of questions to identify a potential candidate's views, and a broad range of answers to select from including, let me explain why my views include elements of both B. and D. above. We could even vote on whether we each feel an issue/question is important, to establish the final list, with some sort of minimum interest expressed standard for a question to be accepted on the list.<br /><br />Then any citizen ('of the people') could establish a profile where they answer the questions, indicating whether they themselves would consider running for office. At the end of the questions one can view matching potential candidates. Potential candidates can have points assigned on a muti-level system, for instance where 100% matches give additional points to that candidate, reduced by an exact percentage basis correlated to how many free-hand answers they provided. In this way we could identify potential candidates that actually represent the largest populace opinions. naturally, to prevent manipulative lying, elected officials would have to be held accountable for their voting records, with an opportunity to explain their votes.<br /><br />This system could also lend itself to campaign finance reform, as lobbyists can only donate funds to a pool based on specific question answers. All candidates who indicated their view that we must maintain balanced budgets (except in the instance of national emergency) would get an equal share of those monies. The funds on our tax forms for the Presidential campaign would also be distributed equally to the remaining candidates after state by state primaries/caucuses/etc. Private contibutions can also be made to a specific candidate. However, the candidates will not be allowed to know the name of the donors... ever. Those records will be made public, but the elected official will be forbidden to access the names, or receive that information from others.<br /><br />The electoral college can remain in place, but "super delegates" cannot. The delegates will be required to vote either unanimously, or by percentage of votes received alloting delegates based on their state's laws.<br /><br />I would be happy to go into more detail or field critiques, and of course, welcome constructive suggestions.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>George Bush got in office twice, was only elected once, and his agenda is still not clear to most. The election law in place at the time of Bush's first ascension to office was not followed, yet he did assume office, so the system is broken. Additionally, when our presidents and congress routinely have approval ratings of less than 33%, even among those who care to participate, something is very wrong. If people were honest, most of the times they have voted in their lifetime, they voted for what they saw as the lesser of two evils, or Rep. or Dem. to block Alex. So the best candidates are not even being fielded. Additionally, if all we can offer are those who lean towards one form of extremisim, or another, it is no wonder many in the rest of the world view the U.S.A. as a dysfunctional, paranoid schizophrenic bully, with a sissy alter-ego multiple personality disorder. I'd laugh out loud, but our futures and very lives are at stake.</div><br />	ricter55	-1	17	18	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2858-4049	
2859-4049	From Bottom Up: Increasing the quality and quantity of local citizenry engagement with critical public issues and the governmen	2009-05-22 00:00:00	Opening the Government and improving public engagement has many aspects being addressed by many and especially by those of us interested in improving the quality dialogue in the citizenry and promoting new ideas for deliberative democracy. One aspect not getting much attention as yet is getting beyond just increasing citizen input to the governing process to also increasing the quality of citizen understanding of the major issues. <br /><br />We Americans are relatively ignorant about the world outside our borders and to some extent outside our regional localities as well. Many are one issue oriented and often 'my backyard' focused. Public engagement and opening the government should perhaps simultaneously address the quality and quantity of participation and collaboration with the government along with the desired 'opening' of the governing structure to more effective engagement. <br /><br />Here are some basic concepts we might follow in this direction. 1) Rather than 'one-off' or occasional encounters, programs to improve dialogue and citizen participation should be sustaining so that those participating can maintain interest and grow in the quality and quantity of their contributions.<br /><br /> 2) We must have real and sustaining diversity in the programs--the 'reds and the blues', the 'farmers and the cowboys' (remembering Oklahoma), the military and the pacifists, etc. 3) And, we must engage the local citizen with the professional advocates of differing policy choices (those at home engaging in the vigorous policy dialogue generated by our leading think tanks on all sides of the issues). Reading only from our textbooks or our condensed issue handbooks is not the same as listening to the debates live or virtually live and then reflecting with their neighbors on what they hear--especially with those of opposing viewpoints. <br /><br />In addition to organizing the open government and public engagement from Washington and the Federal Government out (that is, top-down), let's also work from the bottom up. How many colleges and community colleges with multiple numbers of political science and government teachers do we have in the US? How many high schools with teachers of social studies do we have? How many local branches of the American Legion, the Veterans for Foreign Wars, the League of Women Voters, the NRA, and others do we have? <br /><br />Is there not some way to engage our local leaders in active, sustained dialogue that will both generate new, increased and informed interest in public policy issues and also significantly increase the quality of understanding and resulting engagement in the public dialogue?<br /><br />A phenomenal number of professionals and organizations now exist, and more are appearing each year, with the strategy and competence to carry out this task. Many are in fact already doing the basics of what is suggested here. But a nation-wide and sustainable program is not yet on the table. Is it possible that something like Mayor Khai Degner's Sustainability Summit (May 30, 2009, in Harrisonburg VA) using any of the methodologies like open space, world café, issues forums, sustained dialogue, or many others could be held regularly in virtually every county in the U S? Is it possible that Rotary Clubs, the Eagles, the Elks, the VFW, the American Legion and many other community organizations could be enticed to join in public dialogues about major policy issues? Is it possible that our political scientists and social studies teachers, and others as well, could actively join in to support and to assist such endeavors? <br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>'Open Government' is not a one way street. Not only must we release the bonds so long characteristic of government performance that constrain citizen participation but we must also energize and equip our citizens to engage the government with confidence and increased understanding of the complexities of the governance task. </div><br />	ted.thomas	84	93	9	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2859-4049	
2860-4049	Due diligence and equity in federal hiring	2009-05-22 00:00:00	I work in the State Department and have two main issues:<br /><br />1. RECKLESS HIRING PROCESS: I was accepted with no interview, with a higher salary than needed or likely justified, and I know of others who were brought on in the same fashion--this has to change. A rigorous investigation and set of subsequent hiring requirements seems the very least that should be done.<br /><br />2. UNJUST CATEGORY OF EMPLOYMENT: The term they use for hires such as myself is "personal service contractor" (PSC); it is not a third party contractor, who works for an outside business, and it's not a civil servant, who is a full-fledged government employee. Therefore, my second recommendation is that the category of PSCs in and of itself needs to be seriously rethought, as we are denied every Federal benefit, only receiving sick time, vacation time, and 50% of our health care costs (I know many who were PSCs for 10 plus years, and are now nearing retirement age with hugely smaller retirement savings because of this despicable practice).<br /><br />Additionally, we have little certainty of employment because of year-to-year contracts, even though we perform needed services that clearly are desired beyond a single year. <br /><br />How can we even begin to ask for private employers to treat their employees equitably when we deal with government employment in such an unfair, inhumane fashion? I would implore anyone with the capability of initiating a discussion and/or investigation into PSC use at the State Department to do so, as it is completely unfair on so many fronts.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>If the government is to reform at all, one of the guiding principles must be to become a just, accountable and efficient steward of public resources--these two ideas would be steps in that direction.</div><br />	Fed for fresh thinking	20	26	6	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2860-4049	
2861-4049	Deter Fake Public Participation	2009-05-22 00:00:00	There is an epidemic of fake participation in American government. Fake participation occurs when governments seek the democratic legitimacy but not the accountability that comes with public participation. Fake participation allows politicians to say, "I gave you an opportunity to speak on this legislation and you didn't take it." <br /><br />In the Hitchhikers Guide to the Universe, there are several great scenes with fake participation. They are funny because, for those of us with experience of government, they ring so true. Here is one of those scenes:<br /><br />Mr Prosser: "But the plans were on display…"<br />Arthur: "On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them."<br />Mr Prosser: "That's the display department."<br />Arthur: "With a torch."<br />Mr Prosser: "Ah, well the lights had probably gone."<br />Arthur: "So had the stairs."<br />Mr Prosser: "But look, you found the notice didn't you?"<br />Arthur: "Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard." <br /><br />Fake participation is an element of the much larger and more troublesome phenomenon of fake democracy. Countries with 99% presidential re-election rates or very high legislative incumbent re-election rates are likely to have many fake democracy components. The U.S. is pretty good at limiting most types of fake democracy, if only because we have a genuine two-party system, but fake participation tends to be a sore spot, especially at the local level of government.<br /><br />What steps can be done to identify fake participation? The key is to use enhanced public participation transparency to make fake participation more costly for public officials. What public officials seek to do, as simply a matter of common sense, is control public participation so that unfavorable public participation information becomes more costly for the general public to access than favorable public participation information. Here are a few reforms to limit such bias:<br /><br />Disclose, as part of the web-based public meeting record, all official steps to publicize a meeting, including how much was spent, who spent it, and where and when it was spent. For example, tiny public meeting notice ads in newspaper classified sections should no longer be viewed as legally adequate (even if they are a significant source of revenue and thus government subsidy for our failing local newspapers).<br /><br />Disclose, as part of the web-based public meeting record, which public officials invited a particular individual to represent the public on a particular committee and the press release or other official statement explaining why they chose that individual.<br /><br />Disclose, as part of the web-based public meeting record, the written comments of the public meeting participants. The documents need to be in a searchable format, not, say, in a pdf format.<br /><br />Disclose, as part of the web-based public meeting record, the exact method used for selecting public speakers; e.g., a copy of a blank signup sheet, the place of the signup sheet, the time at which it is publicly posted, the criterion by which the signup sheet is closed, the order of names taken from the signup sheet (e.g., first-come, first-serve), and the guidelines for submitting written comments. <br /><br />Webcast and archive online all public meetings with public participants and allow the participants to attach their written testimony to the webcast/archive so the video is indexed and can easily be searched.<br /><br />When federal and state governments require local public participation, such as public hearings, in order to receive grants (e.g., educational technology grants), include provisions such as the above to discourage fake participation.<br /><br />This is just a preliminary list of policy recommendations. The key first step is to recognize how widespread and serious is the problem of fake participation. Fortunately, thanks to today's information technologies, public policies can readily be implemented to make fake participation more transparent and thus politically costly.<br /><br />--J.H. Snider, President<br />iSolon.org<br /><br />For the author's recent work on related subjects, see:<br /><br />Should the Public Meeting Enter the Information Age?, National Civic Review, Fall 2003<br /><br />The Failure of E-Democracy, paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, August 2005<br /><br />Would You Ask Turkeys to Mandate Thanksgiving?

2864-4049	Address disparate state legislation regarding voter eligibility	2009-05-22 00:00:00	<br /><br /><br />Right now in America, there are over 4 million people - living, working, paying taxes in our communities - who can't participate in the democratic process because of felony convictions. A felony is defined as a crime that carries a potential penalty of one year or longer in prison. Most convicted felons are not violent criminals, and many felons never actually serve any time in prison for their crime. It's also important to note that not all violent crimes are felonies.<br /><br />The Constitution of the United States gives states the power to determine who is eligible to vote based on criminal activity. The way states exercise this power is widely variable, and most states exclude some - but not all - convicted felons from being eligible to vote. Loss of civil rights is not a criminal penalty, and in some states disenfranchisement is permanent. <br /><br />Many people are never able to regain their civil rights due to variable state policies that require waiting periods, payment of fines or restitution, or personal gubernatorial action from the Governor. In attempts to purge convicted felons from local voting rosters, eligible voters are often erroneously purged as well. <br /><br />In some states, disproportionate numbers of ineligible voters are minorities. There is little debate that laws to disqualify felons from voting were put in place largely as a means to suppress the minority vote, most notably in Virginia - where 20% of the total African American population of the state cannot vote in any elections. This year, 9 measures were introduced into the Virginia General Assembly that would modify current law to restore the rights of (some) convicted felons in Virginia, namely those who have served their sentences and/or were convicted of nonviolent felonies. None of them passed.<br /><br />I recommend that the Federal government step up to the plate and exercise its power under the Fourteenth Amendment and address these state policies that prevent large percentages of African Americans from voting, where state legislature has repeatedly failed to do so.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Because true democracy means everyone should have a say, regardless of the mistakes they've made. </div><br />	dmwilliams80	33	45	12	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2864-4049

Jobs could be supervised by those unemployed that have leadership skills and some re-training could be done too. Those with construction skills could repair and renew neighborhoods, those with child care skills could help care for the children of the more physical workers. It would be a huge force of community workers restoring America - fixing parks, filling in for companies that have had to lay off workers, making cities cleaner and more attractive. Most of the folks I know who have been unemployed would love to do something more productive than checking in once a week at the unemployment office - this could make a huge difference, especially in crumbling cities. And it would be a partially volunteer work force of over 8 million people working on projects that directly help people.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>We have a huge resource of willing workers who have lost jobs, homes and<br />self esteem due to this poor economy....This worked on a much larger scale during the FDR administration. </div><br />	kkibbie	41	46	5	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2866-4049

2868-4049	Provide Citizens with Nonpartisan, Highly-Accessible Guides to Public Issues 	2009-05-22 00:00:00	Doing so will better enable citizens to participate effectively and meaningfully in the various open governance channels and opportunities that are strengthened or created in the coming months. Just as importantly, it will help inoculate citizens against partisan and interest group manipulation, which will be an increasingly difficult challenge as open governance practices become better established and more influential. <br /> <br />Citizen Issue Guides would provide a highly accessible, nonpartisan analysis of issues and their potential solutions--which should include, but not be restricted to, the current two-party debate. Whenever appropriate, they should not only cover what government can do to address an issue, but also what citizens themselves and communities acting together can do. The guides could be widely and affordably distributed through such channels as the Administration's online platforms, federal agencies and congressional offices, libraries, schools and colleges, news outlets, and networks of nonpartisan engagement practitioners such as IAP2, NAPA, NCDD, DDC, NCL, etc. <br /><br />Producing the guides might be the responsibility of a nonpartisan congressional office. Or, they could be the result of a government partnership with the nonprofit sector, particularly those organizations within it that are the most decidedly nonpartisan and otherwise well-suited to the task. (Full disclosure: I work for Public Agenda, a nonpartisan, nonprofit that has specialized in creating such citizen guides for over two decades and using them as essential elements of public engagement campaigns.) <br /><br />Whomever might be responsible for creating the issue guides, it is worth noting in this time of fiscal stress that they are a relatively cost-effective means for helping to ensure the quality and integrity of public participation. It takes some resources to do them well and distribute them widely, but in the scheme of things it would be a fairly modest investment and the return is likely to be strong. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	wfriedman	57	67	10	8	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2868-4049

I later found out that the reason I was sending money to my father was to support his drug habit. I also was sending money to my single sister who was raising children.

Lawyers advising the Department of Interior suggested the FACA prevented a Federal Task Force from meeting jointly with a Governor's Commission made up of a range of stakeholders and federal, state, local and tribal interests. In response to this, Congress passed the 1996 Water Resources Development Act and addressed this by two new provisions: <br /><br /> 1. They recreated the Task Force as one with federal, state, local and tribal representatives; <br /> 2. They provided Everglades restoration consensus building efforts supported by the Task Force with a FACA <br /> exemption.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>FACA can provide a significant roadblock to collaboration and broad participation in solution seeking consensus efforts.

(Other countries issue them while you wait; why can't we do this??).<br /><br />Currently, most citizens must go through the post office to get their passport books or cards for the first time. And while the Post Office charges a $25 handling fee, there are always long lines and delays (it is the post office, after all) and rarely dedicated personnel who deal only with passports.

2881-4049	Collaborative Governance- Federal, State and Local Government Roles	2009-05-22 00:00:00	Collaborative governance has become the context for finding real solutions to complex public challenges faced by citizens around the country. In practice, principally at the state, regional and local levels (i.e. the "laboratories of democracy"), the public solutions collaborative governance system is one where leaders convene all sectorsâ&euro;&rdquo;public, private, and civicâ&euro;&rdquo;to develop effective, lasting solutions to public problems that go beyond what any sector could achieve on its own.<br /><br />The System is based on principles of: transparency and accountability; equity and inclusiveness; effectiveness and efficiency; responsiveness; forum neutrality; and consensus-based decision making. It relies on: a Sponsor (an agency, foundation, civic organization, public-private coalition, etc. to initiate support); a Convener/Leader (A governor, legislator, local official, respected civic leader, etc. with power to bring diverse people together to work on common problems); a Neutral Forum (an impartial organization or venue, etc. to provide and ensure skilled process management); and participation of all sectors (public, private, civic, etc.) to ensure representation of all interests and points of view.<br /><br />In operation, this system involves the following six steps with continuous feedback among them. While they work in sequence, they also work together: <br /><br />1. Sponsors identify and raise an issue or opportunity that calls for a collaborative response.<br />2. Assessment is made on the feasibility for collaboration and who needs to be involved.<br />3. Leader(s) convene all needed participants.<br />4. Participants adopt this framework for addressing the issue.<br />5. Conveners and participants frame (or reframe) the issue for deliberation.<br />6. Neutral forum/facilitator designs and conducts a process to negotiate interests and integrate resources.<br />7. Written agreement establishes accountability.<br /><br />The Policy Consensus Initiative and the National Policy Consensus Center along with the University Network for Collaborative Governance have helped to produce both resources for leaders and convenors (http://www.policyconsensus.org/publicsolutions/ps_6.html) and resources for practitioners and neutral forums (http://www.policyconsensus.org/publicsolutions/ps_7.html).<br /><br />The effective participation of federal agencies in collaborative governance initiatives at the multi-state, state, regional and local levels often is necessary to find solutions to the challenged faced but has proved to be difficult in practice. Federal agencies need more explicit encouragement and support. the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution based in Tuscon has made progress with the family of environmental agencies at the federal level. What is needed is documentation of best practices, guidance on memorandum of understanding that capture the roles and responsibilities in these efforts and hands on training, coaching and mentoring that is explicitly multi-sector in focus.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Collaborative governance solutions require the effective participation of all levels of government and a broad range of stakeholders. For the new administration's open government and collaboration strategies to produce successful outcomes, attention needs to be paid to improving the "infrastructure" for supporting collaboration.</div><br />	rmjones	36	38	2	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2881-4049

2886-4049	The Office of Illness Prevention	2009-05-22 00:00:00	The reason we have a health care crisis is because we have a health crisis. People are getting sicker sooner. The present generation is predicted to have a shorter average lifespan than the previous generation. From my research, the odds are very high that within the next two decades, every American will be suffering from some disease or illness, much of which will be untreatable. I know of no health care system that can possible keep up with that patient load, and the proposals on the table to fix the present system are just bandaids. <br /><br />We need an Office of Illness Prevention (OIP). Prevention is clearly the answer to the health care crisis - you would only need access to health care in the case of an accident or injury. In actuality, this country does not have a true health care system, it has a BigPharma-funded illness maintenance system instead, that treats symptoms with a litany of dangerous drugs and medical procedures. Even the term "preventive medicine" is an oxymoron. Why would anyone need medicine to stay healthy? There really is no illness prevention industry because there is no money in it - it is an anathema to the medical community, which has the distinction of being the third leading cause of death in the US. As a holistic health practitioner and author of several books on illness prevention,including "The Wellness Project," I strongly advocate the formation of a totally independent committee to operate the Illness Prevention Office. It must be independent of: the food industry, the industry-controlled FDA/EPA/USDA triangle, Big Pharma, the medical community, the health insurance industry, the Surgeon General, the NIH, and even the herbal and supplement industries. It would conduct gov't funded university research into areas that have been completely ignored, such as using nature as a paradigm for health (I have personally already funded such research with great results: www.montecitowellness.com ). <br /><br />Those consumers that follow the guidelines from the OIP would receive substantial reductions for catastrophe coverage, which is all they would need, much to the horror of the medical insurance industry. There would be an anti-revolving-door policy as follows: anyone who has worked at one of the blacklisted agencies or industries listed above would not be able to work on any OIP project for at least a year after quitting their other post. All of the research from the OIP would be posted free of charge to the world community, and there would be open dialog and feedback between consumers and the OIP via the web. New professional designations would be created for Illness Prevention Practitioners, most of whom would have science backgrounds, but not necessarily medical degrees. Prevention should be part of a mandatory curriculum taught in every medical school that receives Federal funds (all of them). Ultimately, Illness Prevention would become a worldwide initiative, changing the face of health, and health care, as we know it.<br /><br />Roy Mankovitz, Director<br />Montecito Wellness, LLC<br />Illness Prevention Research<br />www.montecitowellness.com<br />roy@montecitowellness.com<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It is the longterm solution to the healthcare crisis.</div><br />	roy	20	28	8	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2886-4049	
2887-4049	Identify inhibitors to Obama's vision of bottom-up democracy	2009-05-22 00:00:00	An international team of practitioners of the science of Structured Dialogic Design (SDD) met online off and on this past December and January. They worked together to discover the roadblocks facing President Barack Obama in realizing his vision of a bottom-up democracy for the people and with the people of the United States of America. (For a full and transparent view of their activities go to: http://obamavision.wikispaces.com. <br /><br />There were 15 active participants and several observers. They were located in Canada, United States, Mexico, England, Germany, Cyprus, South Africa, Australia, and Japan. The team participated asynchronously (different places at different times employing the Webscope wiki) http://obamavision.wikispaces.com for the beginning stages of SDD. The group then met synchronously (different places at the same time using web conferencing) for the influence structuring sessions. <br />The triggering question addressed was: <br /><br />"In the context of Obama's vision for engaging stakeholders from all walks of life in a bottom-up democracy employing Internet technology, what factors do we anticipate, on the basis of our experiences with SDDP, will emerge as inhibitors to the actualization of his vision?"<br /><br />The participants generated 59 inhibitors and clarified them with 60+ messages. They gathered the inhibitors into 13 clusters and then each participant cast 5 votes for the inhibitors they deemed most important. 15 inhibitors received 2 or more votes.<br /><br />In round 5, the participants engaged in synchronous interaction to construct a relational map displaying the influences among factors of higher relative importance, as determined from the voting results of Round 4. This "root cause map" draws distinctions between factors that exert strong leverage, appearing at the roots of the relational tree (map), and factors that are less influential appearing at the branches of the tree. Drawing these distinctions is critical in the design of a solution to the roadblocks for actualizing bottom-up democracy. Without diagnosing the roots of the issue the stakeholders run the risk of allocating resources to the symptoms and not the causes of the problem. <br /><br />The deepest drivers, the inhibitors with the greatest leverage, identified by the participants are:<br /><br />Corporate control of the means of democracy emerged as the most influential inhibitor to the realization of the bottom-up democracy vision. In other words, in accordance with the majority vote of the team, the initiative that exerts the highest leverage in inhibiting the practice of bottom-up democracy is the corporate control of the means of democracy.<br /><br />Insufficient attention given to facilitator capacitation emerged as the second most influential inhibitor. Dr. Tom Flanagan provides a narrative regarding this inhibitor. <br /><br />"It is perhaps no great surprise that when a panel of systems scientists from across the globe pull their heads together around challenges that President Obama is likely to face that the most influential factor underlying the success of such an outcome was judged to be the commitment that government leaders and agencies actually hold in supporting a grassroots effort. The global design team phrased this as 'insufficient attention given to facilitator capacitation.' <br /><br />"Enabling pathways for many, many voices with many, many ideas to flow in an orderly fashion toward the highest summits of national thinking is not going to be an easy process." <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>A systems approach such as that used in the obamavision sessions discovers the root causes that lie behind difficult situations and hinder progressive efforts. Subsequent concentration on those root causes lifts all the efforts in the tree above them. It enables coordination among many diverse efforts and a meshing of gears among efforts that might otherwise spin in isolation.</div><br />	ken	9	15	6	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2887-4049	
2888-4049	Housing Crisis Fix has been delivered to Treasury	2009-05-22 00:00:00	This plan was submitted to Laurie Maggiano, Chief of the Homeowner Preservation Office (department of Treasury), Director Donna Gambrell, CDFI Fund (department of Treasury), Seth Wheeler, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Finance, and Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Kohn's office.<br /><br />What do you think of it?<br /><br /><br />"The GOLDEN TICKET MORTGAGE Plan" <br /><br />created by Anthony Migyanka<br />Chairman, A.G. Foster-Lowry Financial Services<br />9400 N. MacArthur Blvd., #124-627<br />Irving, Texas 75063<br />http://mobilemoneyminute.wordpress.com<br />mobilemoneyminute@yahoo.com<br /><br />Submitted to Laurie Maggiano, Chief of Homeowner Preservation Office, Department of US Treasury<br /><br /><br />Problems to be solved by the "GTM" plan:<br /><br />1. Because of the housing market collapse, an estimated 13,000,000 Americans may walk away from their current mortgages, in addition to the hundreds of thousands who already have.<br /> <br /><br />From an April 23, 2009 Bloomberg.com article:<br /><br />Mortgage delinquencies increased to a seasonally adjusted 7.88 percent of all loans in the fourth quarter, the highest in records going back to 1972, the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington said March 2. Loans in foreclosure rose to 3.3 percent, also a record and up from 2.04 percent a year earlier.<br />Obama's $75 billion plan to reduce foreclosures by modifying mortgages targets as many as 4 million homeowners. Foreclosed properties helped drive down home prices in 20 U.S. cities by an average of 19 percent in January from a year earlier, the fastest decline on record, according to an S&P;/Case-Shiller index.<br /><br />From:<br /><br /><br /><br />Hope for Homeowners<br /><br /><br />Grade: F<br />The Plan: Enacted on Oct. 1, Hope for Homeowners was to be the main foreclosure rescue plan from Congress, which allocated $300 billion for the effort. Supporters in Congress, like Massachusetts Representative Barney Frank, said the program would allow hundreds of thousands of borrowers, perhaps millions, to refinance into lower-cost loans by cutting the amount they owed, which for many at-risk-of-default homeowners was more than their house was worth.<br />The Result: So how many people has Hope for Homeowners saved from foreclosure? Zero. There have been 326 applications in the three months since the program started, but none of those people -- let alone the nearly 6 million homeowners who, by some estimates, may face foreclosure in the next few years -- have received a new mortgage or a modification for the one they have. What's more, none of the major mortgage lenders, such as Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, has signed on to the loan-principal-reduction program -- which gives Hope for Homeowners little chance of being successful anytime soon. "Foreclosure is the problem we have to spend a lot more effort trying to solve," says the Economic Policy Institute's Robert Scott. "We need to put a floor under housing prices, and stopping foreclosures is the way you do that."<br /><br /><br /><br />The "GOLDEN TICKET MORTGAGE" Plan will put these people back into their homes and keep them there.<br /><br />2.From:<br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />The Looming Crisis in Commercial Real Estate<br />By MICHAEL WEISSKOPF Wednesday, Apr. 22, 2009<br /><br /><br /> <br />A sign advertises space for lease at a strip mall in Chicago<br />Scott Olson / Getty<br /><br /><br />The credit crunch has thus far focused on the residential mortgage mess. But with $1.3 trillion in loans to shopping centers and other commercial properties coming due between now and 2013, another time bomb is ticking. In a report scheduled for release on Wednesday, Deutsche Bank estimates that at least half the loans -- and two-thirds of those packaged and resold as securities -- will not qualify for refinancing. As a result, many borrowers will likely default, leading to losses on securitized mortgages of $50 billion or more and losses of at least $200 billion on commercial real estate loans overall, according to Deutsche analyst Richard Parkus, who authored the report. "People are only now beginning to realize there is a looming crisis," Parkus told TIME. <br /><br /><br />Financial analysts believe government incentives to banks to extend existing commercial real estate loans will be necessary to limit the damage.  <br /><br />Property values have plummeted, with sale prices down as much as 45% from the peak in 2007, Deutsche Bank reports. And vacancies are up -- expected by year's end to reach 13.5% for retail and 17% for office buildings -- cutting potential income that commercial properties need to make their mortgage payments. Some areas will be even worse. Vacancy rates in midtown Manhattan, already at 12.7%, are expected to reach 19% by year's end, real estate experts say. <br /><br /><br />The delinquency rate for commercial real estate loans hit 1.8% in March, triple that of a year ago, according to Scott Talbott, a lobbyist for the Financial Roundtable, which represents the largest lenders. "Losses from commercial real estate are the next economic shoe to drop," he said. "This issue has moved to the forefront...."<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Because of the real estate market collapse, and the staggeringly high number of commercial real estate vacancies, projected worsening future vacancies, and the impending bankruptcies of REITs, funds and other commercial real estate investors:<br /><br />Issuing "Golden Ticket Mortgages" for these properties would, like the residential "GTM", freeze the asset value of their properties, put in a sound floor price for their markets, and keep borrowers paying their mortgages.<br /><br /><br />3.From Bloomberg.com:<br /><br />Mortgage Investors Form Battle Lines Over Housing Aid (Update1)  <br /><br />By Jody Shenn<br />April 23 (Bloomberg) -- The head of Greenwich Financial Services LLC warned bond investors in Washington last month that government efforts to reverse the housing slump are doing more harm than good by undermining debt contracts.<br /><br />Prices of many mortgage bonds have plummeted in the past two years as delinquency rates on the underlying loans soared. Mounting losses from securities tied to subprime home-loans caused credit markets to seize up in August 2007, triggering a slowdown in the U.S. economy that spread around the world. <br /><br />Fixing the mortgage market and stabilizing housing prices would help Obama end the worst U.S. recession since 1982. <br /><br />The U.S. mortgage-finance system depends on bond investors. About 64 percent of the value of America's home loans is bundled into bonds, a market that is 10 percent bigger than the sum of Treasuries outstanding. Mortgages account for 80 percent of consumer debt, and housing costs represent about 22 percent of the economy, Federal Reserve and Hoover Institution data show. <br /><br /><br />A congressionally appointed panel overseeing the U.S.'s $700 billion finance-industry bailout said in a March 6 report that government action is needed to encourage loan modifications because soaring foreclosures "injure both the investor and the homeowner."<br />Obama's Plan<br />Mortgage delinquencies increased to a seasonally adjusted 7.88 percent of all loans in the fourth quarter, the highest in records going back to 1972, the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington said March 2. Loans in foreclosure rose to 3.3 percent, also a record and up from 2.04 percent a year earlier.<br /><br />While billed as beneficial to mortgage investors, Obama's plan will mostly be ineffective in cutting losses because it focuses on lowering payments rather than reducing homeowner debt, said John Geanakoplos, an economics professor at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Many borrowers with "negative equity" will choose to default anyway, he said. <br /><br /><br />The congressionally approved program was designed to help 400,000 borrowers when it started in October; 51 of the loans have closed, said Lemar Wooley, an FHA spokesman. <br /><br /><br /><br />With the clogging of the secondary market of RMBSs and CMBSs, banks are unwilling or incapable of lending because of lower capital ratios.<br /><br />A "Golden Ticket Mortgage" can be issued to any bank in a dollar-for-dollar exchange with that bank for their "toxic" assets on their balance sheet. <br /><br />The value of the banks' "Golden Ticket Mortgages" would be at the current mark-to-market rates.<br /><br />Additionally, the Treasury SPV created to manage the "GTM" plan could open a window at its discretion to buy or sell loans or MBSs from banks or private capital at different higher bid prices, depending upon bank TCE needs, demand for such assets by private capital, or further retirement/re-securitization of underperforming loans.<br /><br /><br />The bank's "Golden Ticket Mortgage" acts as a credit facility, but because it is now off the balance sheet and being held by Treasury (in a newly-created SPV), it would count toward Tangible Common Equity, and allow banks to resume lending and creating/selling new MBSs.<br /><br />No financial incentives will be needed to bring private capital back to the secondary lending market.<br /><br />By issuing "Golden Ticket Mortgages, Treasury will have firmed up the underlying loans, whether residential or commercial mortgages, on the front end, and will have therefore firmed up the securitized RMBSs or CMBSs on the back end, all without having spent one taxpayer dollar.<br /><br />The legacy assets will turn into re-performing loans, or be retired, with the refinancing of the underlying mortgages, as now the real estate market is re-inflated to market values that match the current outstanding principal of loans, which is an instant credit boom, which will set off a corresponding refinancing boom (easily facilitated by the "Make Home Affordable" plan for homeowners). Therefore, these newly-performing loans will attract higher prices in the secondary MBS market, and with those profits, Treasury will have the ability to assist the worst of the worst homeowner/no-doc/ARM/interest-only dreck that is clogging up the market by providing Treasury aid to those homeowners, in an attempt to keep them in their homes too, and also create another market for single-family home rental properties in the instances where refinancing is impossible, and create a slew of taxable events that will pay for the cost of subsidizing ARM refinancing.<br /><br />A few of the taxable events caused by issuing "Golden Ticket Mortgages":<br /><br />a. Retiring of MBS bonds.<br />b. Refinancing of underlying borrower mortgages.<br />c. The sale of a "GTM" home, and subsequent re-purchase of another residential mortgage. <br />d. Increased property tax revenues due to people remaining in their homes, in active repayment of their "GTMs".<br />e. The increase in lending/borrowing that will occur as a result of the credit boom, due to the re-inflation of the housing market "GTMs".<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Under these three prior scenarios, the "Golden Ticket Mortgage" itself would literally be a certificate issued by the US Treasury. It would not be backed by a Treasury bond or other liquid asset, as it would be a credit facility, in each case. <br /><br />No cash needs to change hands for these scenarios to be successfully transacted.<br /><br />It is akin to similar IRS creations such as the FHA loan, 1031 Exchange or other incentives that affect the accounting of real estate transactions and bank capital ratios, and do not need liquidity to facilitate the transaction.<br /><br />It would not require the expenditure of any TARP, Treasury or taxpayer funds, save only the cost of literally printing the "Golden Ticket" certificates, and the expense of managing the Treasury SPV through the vendor, A.G. Foster-Lowry Financial Services, which be estimated at less than $50MM per annum, but of course will be virtually insignificant when compared to the newly-created tax revenue generated by the taxable events as stated above.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />SCENARIO 4: <br /><br />THE CREATION OF A NEW TREASURY SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE (SPV) to manage the credit boom and refinancing boom caused by the issuance of "Golden Ticket Mortgages."<br /><br /><br />While we believe that simply issuing Treasury certificates will satisfy the necessary transaction requirements of scenarios 1-3 in the "Golden Ticket Mortgage" plan, we also believe that the issuance of "Golden Ticket Mortgages" can do even more to further the goal of Treasury, which is to end the current deflationary spiral, restart the financial economy in the United States, bring private capital back into the real estate and capital markets, and keep American citizens in their homes.<br /><br />The issuance of "Golden Ticket" Treasury certificates will take care of all citizens, REITs, funds and investors capable of making their current mortgage payments, or, with the addition of a "GTM," capable of refinancing their mortgage to a lower rate/payment, and, UNLIKE CURRENT PILOT PROGRAMS, IT WILL ENCOURAGE AMERICANS TO DO SO.<br /><br />However, we also realize that while the "Golden Ticket Mortgage" plan will alleviate the suffering of millions of individual Americans and businesses, it is not a panacea. Further work is necessary to help all Americans, especially the ones caught up in the credit destruction such as ARMs, no-doc loans, interest-only, and other "exotic" mortgage products that have ruined a significant percentage of American citizen's ability to borrow, buy a home and the corresponding wealth evaporation of the individual as well as the investor financing the underlying investment.<br /><br />Additionally, we believe that the creation of a new Treasury SPV, managed by A.G. Foster-Lowry, will solve three more Treasury's problems:<br /><br />1.The newly-created Treasury SPV will provide liquidity to Americans under served by simple refinancing, such as people currently in foreclosure, Americans who have suffered credit destruction due to ARMs and other exotic mortgage products, and allow them to repair their credit with manageable repayment plans as well as make credit affordable to them to purchase or modify or remain in their homes. The SPV will "separate the wheat from the chaff," by retiring current MBSs and in doing so, cutting out from the MBSs the non-performing loans, pumping liquidity and credit facilities into the worst neighborhoods, and re-securitizing the "good" loans firmed up by "Golden Ticket Mortgages," and paying for it with the newly-created tax revenues as well as the sale of MBSs re-securitized by Freddie Mac, to investors eager to buy "GTM"-backed loans that have a stable market floor price.<br /><br /><br />2.The newly-created Treasury SPV will solve the problem of what to do with problem child FREDDIE MAC. <br />We recommend creating a reverse-merger with A.G. Foster-Lowry Financial Services and FREDDIE MAC, and renaming the public entity Treasury-Owned New Liquidity for Markets International and Global (TONY MIG). We recommend financing TONY MIG with the issuance of a 15-year Treasury bond: a callable convertible global debenture at 1.95%. We recommend issuing shares of TONY MIG to Treasury in exchange for Congress's shares of FREDDIE MAC, and using issuing a share exchange for all outstanding FREDDIE MAC shareholders, using TONY MIG capital from the bond issuance and $30,000,000,000 of Congressionally-approved TARP funds. We recommend TONY MIG be set up with parallel funds. In accordance with FANNIE MAE and GINNE MAE parlance, calling the 15-yr TONY MIG bond, a "JUNIOR", and the companion bond, a parallel sinking fund to purchase and retire "Juniors" with earnings from the SPV operation, the "SOPHIA" fund. We recommend Juniors convert to 11% of outstanding shares of TONY MIG. TONY MIG will purchase loans from troubled banks and securitize them with the newly-merged Freddie Mac securitization agency capability. <br /><br /><br />3.TONY MIG, by its participation in the capital markets, especially in the financing of loans and securitization of them, will become the "Super-Regulator" Treasury Secretary Geithner believes (as do we) is necessary in our capital/financial markets moving forward, to eliminate the moral hazard created by bailing out the current participants in the financial markets crisis. TONY MIG will have the ability to act quickly in times of future financial crisis, to purchase "toxic" assets with its own capital, and not have to rely on private capital to restart a clogged or abandoned market. TONY MIG can also quickly improve TCE with the further issuance of "Golden Ticket Mortgages," before the collapse of financial institutions like Lehman Brothers, or the near collapse of Bear Stearns or IndyMac Bank, or Washington Mutual, need take place.<br /><br />If we have learned any lessons in the recent market collapse, we have learned speed is of the essence in preventing the domino effect of credit destruction and wealth evaporation across the entire economy.<br /><br />Additionally, being a global debenture, TONY MIG can assist other countries in their own "bailouts," providing rapid liquidity to international capital markets, real estate markets, and foreign government assistance.<br /><br />Also, by being a global debenture, TONY MIG can list on multiple stock exchanges worldwide, to take advantage of differences in local accounting rules and currency fluctuations, that will further improve the facility of the "Sophia" fund, as well as improve the capital position of the SPV in general. (For instance, Australian accounting rules count preferred shares as an asset, not as a liability; other countries retain the ability to keep intangible assets (like the value of a "GTM" guarantee) on the balance sheet, and not have to write it down as goodwill or depreciate it over time, and the ability to write up assets we believe are worth more than we paid for them.<br /><br /><br />In Summary, the four facets of the "Golden Ticket Mortgage" plan solve the current deficiencies in the financial marketplace for Treasury, create a market "Super-Regulator" to remove the bailout moral hazard moving forward, and restart the US and global economy.<br /><br /><br />A.G. Foster-Lowry is uniquely positioned to provide all the services necessary to:<br /><br />A. Issue "GTM"s. With our proprietary software, (we are also launching as SEC-mandated online shareholder forums for public companies), we can handle the millions of "GTM" requests and applications by American citizen residential homeowners and commercial property owners.<br /><br />B. We can work efficiently with current Treasury vendors like Alluvion Securities, to provide updated "GTM" recipients' information to Alluvion and other lead banks, to better inform their MBS pools of which underlying mortgages have been converted to "GTM"s, and therefore will not only firm up said RMBSs and CMBSs, but also fetch a higher price for them on the secondary market. <br /><br />C.With our proprietary software, Treasury "GTM" recipients (and this includes individual citizens, REITs and banks) will be able to communicate with Treasury via our secure web portal's email, blogs, postings, and calendars, to provide timely notifications of "GTM" approvals/retirings and/or Treasury status updates of TONY MIG "GTM" retirings via the "Sophia" companion bond, or other TONY MIG investment news, press releases, etc.<br /><br />D.With our proprietary software, Treasury can send out SMS alerts to "GTM" recipients, as well as investors, to notify them of updates at our web portal: for "GTM" approvals, status updates, new TONY MIG or Treasury press releases, quarterly filings, etc.<br /><br />E. With our proprietary software venture, Mobile Money Minute (tm), Treasury can send 60-second video updates, distributed via our tv/web/mobile platform to "GTM" recipients, shareholders, media, news outlets and investors.<br /><br />F. With our proprietary software, Treasury can host and tag "GTM" applications, information on newly-created RMBSs, CMBSs or other TONY MIG financial data in XBRL, and post it at the TONY MIG web portal for easier searching by MBS investors, TONY MIG shareholders, and the public at large.<br /><br />G. Additionally, with our proprietary software, Treasury can communicate efficiently and securely with its lead banks, and other vendor/partners and multiple departments and agencies in its own policy initiatives.<br /><br /><br />Faithfully Submitted by:<br /><br /><br />Anthony G. Migyanka<br />Chairman<br />A.G. Foster-Lowry Financial Services<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Our "Golden Ticket Mortgage" program is an asset freeze. What it says is, to American homeowners or commercial property owners, the Treasury will guarantee the value of your home--freeze it to the current outstanding principal of your mortgage--for 60 months. So, if you bought a home for $200,000, but its "market" value is currently $150,000, you are under water, and thinking about how you can get out of your home and your mortgage. But with a "Golden Ticket", if you still owed, say, $195,000 of principal (the rest of your payment is interest), then you would have a "Golden Ticket Mortgage" for $195,000, and your home would be worth at least $195,000 for the next 60 months.<br /><br />That would be an instant credit boost to you. It would give you more favorable credit for refinancing. It would allow you to sell it at a higher value, and it would give you confidence to remain in your home and making your current mortgage payments without the need to refinance, if you so choose.<br /><br />We project it will keep 3,000,000 Americans in their current homes, paying their current mortgages (and glad to do it), it will assist 9,000,000 to refinance or sell their troubled mortgage/home, and it will provide assistance to 2,000,000 people currently going through the credit destruction of those "exotic" mortgage products like option ARMs, interest-only loans, etc.<br /><br /><br />It would also act as a similar credit facility for "toxic" MBSs. It would freeze the asset value of a bank's MBS at its current mark-to-market value, which they have to update quarterly. Treasury would guarantee that value and place the asset into the Treasury SPV, TONY MIG, and in exchange give the bank a "Golden Ticket" worth the asset value, that would count toward Tangible Common Equity, and allow them to lend again, and make new (better credit) MBSs.<br /><br />The "Golden Ticket" MBSs would fetch a higher price from private capital in the secondary market than their asset freeze price in the "GTM" for two reasons: one, a floor is now guaranteed by Treasury on them, and two, the underlying mortgages (at least some of them, and maybe all of them) will be guaranteed by "GTM"s themselves, ensuring a higher percentage of performing loans in those MBSs.<br /><br />That alone will allow the program to more than pay for itself, (a net gain to Treasury), and with the combination of the additional myriad taxable events it will create: "GTM" refinancing, MBS retirings and formation of new bonds through a reinvigorated Freddie Mac, asset sales, to name a few...<br /><br />this program could make Treasury billions that could be used to assist in the credit repair (and residential mortgage repair) of the tens of thousands of homes currently in foreclosure due to the nastiest of the "exotic" ARMs, interest-only loans, etc., and put people back on a solid credit footing, as well as put them back into homes, boosting the value of those neighborhoods currently rotting in foreclosure from the walk-aways.</div><br />	mobilemoneyminute	-11	3	14	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2888-4049	
2889-4049	Small business / residential energy efficiency	2009-05-22 00:00:00	I believe that a combination of tax credits, rebates, low interest start up loans and federal subsidies, and an effort to encourage state and local compliance and cooperation should be used to help small, independent businesses with the goal of improving residential home energy efficiency. <br /><br />Helping residences get up to date weatherization, improve the efficiency of the appliances, perhaps adding solar panels and/or other alternative, sustainable energy sources will help the homeowners reduce their yearly energy costs, help the contractors provide employment, help the manufacturers by creating a demand.<br /><br />Tax credits or rebates should be made available for residential alternative energy installations, even when the new installation won't pay for itself in the short run.

2893-4049	COMMUNITY WEAVING AMERICA	2009-05-22 00:00:00	We propose Community Weaving America! The mission is unique. We are weaving a new world one Good Neighbor at a time to...(the people engaged in Community Weaving complete the mission statement!) The time has come for people to be connected! Community Weaving creates an infrustructure in the grass roots comprised of people willing to be Good Neighbors who will serve as a support system. This system is needed in order to maintain social order as government becomes more open and transparent. This infrasture will provide government with the means to track how the people are adapting to change so they can respond to the needs and empower the people. <br /><br />Community Weaving America creates an infrastructure within the grassroots that will help people assimilate information, identify hot spots, and create an adaptable citizenry that can be mobilized to maintain social order in times of chaos and confusion. We must prepare for the times ahead and work together! <br /><br />Community Weaving started in 1993 and America is filled with Good Neighbors and trained Community Weavers. Government can help build the effort exponentially by adopting Community Weaving practices as a new mode of operation. www.communityweaving.org <br /><br />Governing systems are not able to meet the rising demand for services using current management practices. Too many people with too few representatives to reflect the voice of the people. <br /><br />Recommend creating open and transparent governance system by training government staff how to engage citizens as Good Neighbors using a free web-based tool GoodNeighbors.net that makes human and tangible resources easily and immediately accessible and tracks the shift in reliance on formal systems to informal systems which reduces strain on government. This will require creative action and policy changes whereby agencies integrate Community Weaving practices into service delivery systems. To begin users and consumers will be recruited as Good Neighbors and interwoven into a new social safety net at the grassroots. This will create a whole system functioning of formal and informal community systems. This approach reduces the number of people relying on government systems to get their needs met because they will have free and direct access to the resources of the Family Support Network. <br /><br />Family Support Networks are self-organized by Good Neighbors across the country. These networks are comprised of Good Neighborsa and places where people from diverse socio-economic backgrounds can get connected and find support from their neighbors. Anyone connected into the network as a Good Neighbor can access the resources of the network for free...no lines...no paperwork, no qualifying! This approach creates a more adaptable and equitable system of support owned and operated by the people. Taxpayers pay for social services, yet not everyone has access to the information and services. It's time everyone has access to the resources they are paying for! <br /><br />Community Weaving makes a plethora of resources available for a minimal investment of taxpayer dollars. In 2006, 175,000 volunteer hours were tracked, valued as $2.6 million in volunteerism, on a budget less than $25,000. The funds saved can be used to serve the higher needs populations! Since the network is virtual, there is not need to pay for large buildings and costs associated with running them! <br /><br />Suggest all government staff register as Good Neighbors to weave everyone together before lay offs leave people with valuable skills and abilities stranded and disenfranchised. <br /><br />Train trainers in social services offices how to revamp policies to engage clients as Good Neighbor volunteers. This will leverage a myriad of human and tangible resources and increase social capital. This will capture the skills of the consumers and grow community capacity. <br /><br />By training Community Weavers within organizations across community sectors people from diverse socio-eonomic backgrounds will be interwoven to reweave the fabric of community. This will break down silos and reduce duplication. <br /><br />By training staff and citizens within the community as Community Weavers bridges are built to cross consumers over and connect them to the resources they need to get back on their feet with dignity and respect. Many will slef-organize into Family Support Networks and create their own informal systems of support that will prevent people from requiring formal assistance. By engaging consumers as Good Neighbors the government can play in instrumental role in re-weaving America and increasing community capacity to reduce reliance on formal systems and create resilient communities. <br /><br />This approach weaves people into the broader community system. By integrating the Community Forum into Community Weaving, the voice of the people creates an accountability system to public officials. <br /><br />In other words, Community Weaving reweaves the fabric of community and creates a more informed and engaged citizenry that is an integral part of the process of democracy. <br /><br />Community Weaving America is the change we need to save our children's future and create a more caring, just and civil society! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Must change the way government services are being delivered. Not sufficient resources to meet the rise in demand for assistance. The people are very capable of coming up with creative solutions to meet their own needs in their communities.

2894-4049	American Idol format to vote on appropriate issues	2009-05-22 00:00:00	Evolve Democracy. Engage our populace in the decision making process. Use an online process to determine an acceptable issue. Obviously this would not begin with a matter of national security. <br /><br />A simple vote chooses an issue for the cycle from a list of 25 issues. Then, a process chooses a dozen people to present arguments, presentations, dramas, whatever in support of their idea of how the issue should be addressed. This presentation is in an American Idol format with the judges, but it is America that decides, not them. They express their opinions. Then, a week goes by in which everyone's facts are checked (all sources, including tradional news sources, bloggers, the entire gamut in a due dilligence attempt to make sure all statements are accurate).and the conversation brews. <br /><br />At the end of the week, an online location shows whose facts need trimming and a vote takes place to choose the top three ideas for how to proceed.<br /><br />The next day is the final Television show, the finale. The three top ideas are represented by their presenters and all three describe their idea for how the final solution might integrate something of all three ideas. Then, America votes and we know the next morning how the vote went. Let's say that's a Thursday and the law goes into effect the following Monday at noon.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Democracy has devolved into its lowest common denominator, a winner take all system. It needs to evolve to a system that incorporates an honest attempt to integrate all points of view before a decision is made. Even our presidential debates are full of distortion which is a complete mismanagement of our system. Our democracy needs a tuneup. American Idol has proved itself an attractive model to our culture at this time.</div><br />	infoprog	-29	5	34	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2894-4049	
2895-4049	a Citizen Councilor Network: scaleable, manageable, measureable	2009-05-22 00:00:00	(this idea was also submitted to Google's "Project 10 to the 100" at www.project10tothe100.com/)<br /><br />More background on this idea is available at:<br />www.KingCounty.gov/operations/auditor/CommunityForums and<br />www.CommunityForums.org<br /><br />WHAT ONE SENTENCE BEST DESCRIBES THIS IDEA?<br />This idea improves upon the common notion of a "public hearing" by taking it "to scale" and capturing the opinions of all participants anywhere they meet.<br /><br />DESCRIBE THE IDEA IN MORE DEPTH.<br />Using a "distributed" public hearing methodology, more people can participate, more opinions can be collected, and more nuanced consensus can be revealed than is evidenced at any typical public hearing. Distributed public hearings scale more easily to larger systems of public participation.<br /><br />This new idea for distributing public hearings -- called the "Citizen Councilor Network" -- is CURRENTLY BEING MODELED in King County, Washington. The people of King County recognize that many have difficulty participating meaningfully in government processes that rely primarily on public hearings held at locations that are often distant from their residences or workplaces or held at inconvenient times, and so petitioned for the enactment of Initiative 24 in 2007.<br /><br />The focus of the Citizen Councilor Network, as it is currently modeled (but which could be easily scaled up or down in size), is its "Countywide Community Forums." Each forum is a small face-to-face meeting of four to twelve self-selected and registered "Citizen Councilors." The whole process is impartially overseen by the County Auditor. Reports are tabulated and analyzed by citizen volunteers and results are again reviewed by the auditor for fair and accurate interpretation. The entire process RECEIVES NO TAX DOLLARS and is FUNDED ENTIRELY BY DONATIONS by participants and civic-minded businesses and foundations: a partnership of private, nonprofit, and government organizations.<br /><br />WHAT PROBLEM OR ISSUES DOES THIS IDEA ADDRESS?<br />This idea addresses the "problem of scale" when trying to increase civic engagement in deliberative systems such as government.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is not physically possible for ALL people to meet face-to-face at one time and place to talk together. This is why scientific polling was developed -- to get a sense of everyone's opinion without having to talk, literally, to every one.<br /><br />But scientific polls, while mathematically meaningful and informative, do not meet the emotional needs of people to constructively contribute their own opinions and ideas in a representative democracy -- this is why we vote.<br /><br />Only a distributed system (such as voting and this Citizen Councilor Network) -- and not a centralized system (such as regular public meetings) -- can ever hope to offer universal opportunities for civic engagement on a local, regional, and national scale. <br /><br />All opinions collected by a Citizen Councilor Network would be measured by direct survey of each participant. All measured opinions are 100% accurate for the participants as a whole, but because the participants are "self-selected" and not randomly chosen, the results would only be meaningful as a measure for those who participated. But, like voting itself, our decisions are shaped by those who contribute their voices and act on the results. The opinions of the participants will help shape the public discourse until a final, and binding, vote of all the people is eventually conducted.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The benefits from a distributed Citizen Councilor Network accrue to different groups:<br /><br />FOR INDIVIDUALS: a person is not alone in his or her own thoughts but becomes aware of how ones personal opinions are similar to or different from others with different life experiences. This encourages a reflective moment and is the beginning of awareness and dialogue.<br /><br />FOR PUBLIC OFFICIALS: groups of individual opinions are summarized and reported objectively. The interaction between an official and a summary report is a kind of "symbolic dialogue" with all the participants. People are not physically present in front of the official but their opinions on the summary report are. Officials can be more deliberative when analyzing the similar or different points-of-view of their constituents.<br /><br />FOR SOCIETY: "Confrontation of ideas, within an open democratic context, is the mortar which binds a creative society actively searching for solutions to its problems." -- Forum Foundation. Society benefits because each of us benefits when we contribute our opinions individually while respectfully considering the opinions of others.</div><br />	Community Forums of King County, WA: www.CommunityForums.org	33	38	5	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2895-4049

Because of the incredibly complex set of relationships between commercial organizations and the benefits they receive from government, a powerful way to change this would be to make it illegal for a commercial interest to receive benefits from government. Jane Jacobs in her book, Systems of Survival, details what happens when these two sectors of society contaminate each other.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Because the commercial interests are so powerful in this country, they have subverted democracy and laws are made in their interests and not the interests of the society as a whole.</div><br />	blgibb	12	24	12	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2897-4049

That is, tell us who has been wiretapped or spied on when, without a warrant. Don't tell me it's for it's for national security purposes; if you spied without a warrant, that is a violation of the public's rights and we need to know the details. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The media finds out about this anyway; the New York Times reported not long ago on instances in the last administration where they spied on journalists and even a congressman. This goes for all the information on this website--contracts, spending, etc. All this information is nothing extraordinarily new; much of it is already on the public record. But this is a good cause and you should keep going in this direction by releasing details on wireless wiretapping.

This is a hypocrisy of government, because a government created the Fed and then made it a secret claiming to keep it out of politics. Politicians make policy--therefore, the people at the Fed are indeed politicians. They were not elected, yet they have the power to control money supply. They are policy makers in effect, and so they must be audited and accountable like every other policy maker in government. </div><br />	fahimbh	37	46	9	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2899-4049

2902-4049	Review and declassify most (if not all) Federal radio frequency assignment information	2009-05-22 00:00:00	A bit of background. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates use of the radio spectrum by non-Federal entities. A little-known agency, Interdepartmental Radiofrequency Advisory Commission (IRAC), part of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Commerce Department, regulates Federal use of the radio spectrum. FCC records are public and for the most part accessible online. While a small portion of IRAC's records are accessible through FOIA, most are not public.<br /><br />The Federal government controls huge chunks of spectrum, and the public has only aggregate and sketchy knowledge as to how it is used. As a public resource, spectrum usage (including specific assignment information indicating which frequencies are used for which purposes in which locations) should be documented and public, except in a very small number of instances that might pose a concrete and documentable challenge to national security. A transparent spectrum assignment and management process would enable interested individuals, organizations and corporations to assess both Federal and non-Federal spectrum usage as a whole; to identify and eliminate wasteful and inefficient use of what is now a limited resource; and, perhaps most important, enable continuing enterpreneurial efforts in the wireless field.<br /><br />For reasons that are said to be security-related, most Federal radio frequency assignments are either classified or exempt from public release. Though this consideration may at first seem to support a closed database, technology has moved beyond the necessity to conceal or obfuscate specific frequency assignments. All federal agencies (including security agencies and the military) now digitally encrypt sensitive radio transmissions and use other technologies to protect the content of sensitive information. <br /><br />Information on property ownership and water rights is public and available to all who need it. It is time to treat publicly-owned radio spectrum in the same way.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Brings transparency to a crucially important public resource, enables better stewardship of scarce resources, and builds groundwork for new entrepreneurship.</div><br />	Rick Prelinger	33	43	10	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2902-4049

Silo thinking is not sufficient.<br /><br />As Einstein said, "The problems we have created cannot be solved at the level we created them." We must rise to a higher level Of collaborative thinking to address these issues, and dialogue is the forgotten leadership competency that enables us to begin this systems thinking process.<br /><br />ORBITS OF INFLUENCE Model & Licensing<br /><br />● ORBITS OF INFLUENCE provides a powerful, proven, patent-pending leadership dialogue system that was designed specifically to enable diverse leaders from across all spheres of influence to engage in meaningful dialogue organized around the current issues of interest in their community, work and world. The ORBITS OF INFLUENCE model has been tested with leaders across North Texas in gatherings of up to 150 at a time, has produced consistent, successful results, and has sustained an ongoing, dynamic dialogue series among a growing, diverse community of participants (the ORBITS OF INFLUENCE system can scale up to 200 leader-participants per session).<br /><br />● Cities, universities, corporations, schools and nonprofits are now able to license this leadership dialogue system, to create this leadership dialogue for their own constituencies, where the scope of the dialogue topics (our "UNIVERSE OF IDEAS") is customized to encompass, and enable the participants to address, the specific universe of issues most important and critical to that particular group. <br /><br />Because the UNIVERSE OF IDEAs or scope of discussion for each ORBITS event is "scalable" - in other words, the scope of dialogue for each gathering maybe selected by the organization or group of participants holding the event - the ORBITS OF INFLUENCE model may be customized to enable diverse groups of any size to address critical issues within the safe and open space that dialogue creates.<br /><br />● ORBITS OF INFLUENCE provides a complete system to enable the convening organization to progressively guide those diverse leadership conversations from dialogue to visioning, and on to shared, collective action, as the participants assume leadership for positive change. It does this through a sophisticated, cohesive system of equipment, innovative components, facilitation kits, materials, training, on-site facilitation, and an online community with collaborative spaces and tools, accessible to all participants.<br /><br />● The ORBITS OF INFLUENCE dialogue model was designed to be shared - for other cities and organizations to be able to easily adopt and/or license the ORBITS process and its turn-key package of innovative dialogue tools, to create their own space for transformational dialogue wherever diverse groups need to better understand different perspectives, and then move collectively into shared action.<br /><br />The ORBITS OF INFLUENCE MODEL (USPTO Patent Pending) JULIE ANN TURNER & COMPANY • www.orbitsofinfluence.com • For ORBITS OF INFLUENCE Information, contact 972.612.2131 • © 2009 JULIE ANN TURNER & COMPANY<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>ORBITS OF INFLUENCE Social Innovation Initiative was designed to provide a co-creative space and proven master process through which diverse leaders may come together in dialogue to address and co-create sustainable solutions for the pivotal issues and ideas of our lives, work and world.

Such rationals were promoted as part of President Johnson's War on Poverty in the 1960s. Such a federal requirement in local program administration will do more to build community empowerment than the actual programs themselves. The above-referenced Power Point focuses on a municipal planning effort in Austin, Texas, that was not implemented. However, a similar structure has been implemented in the same locality with Austin Community College, of which I am a member of the Board of Trustees.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Building citizen empowerment is much more than mere programs. Such efforts must fundamentally include a way to build information-processing that can build trust and power over time. Such efforts must be geographically grounded so adjacent communities can learn from each other, and coincidently, not be geographically issolated. In fact, it is the continued issolation of people in community, and the "volunteer" leadership patterns that continues to ensure that fewer and fewer citizens participage in community democracy. A coordinated structure is necessary to begin to change this on-going dynamic.</div><br />	tim mahoney	15	17	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2904-4049

2908-4049	Random Citizen Congress	2009-05-22 00:00:00	One way to increase participation in the legislative process is to poll the citizenry prior to an actual vote in the House or Senate. To make the poll relatively unbiased, begin by having a computer algorithm divide the Nation into districts of 30,000, as specified in the Constitution; then, before Congress votes on a bill, choose one person at random in each district, send them an email with a link to the bill's text, and record their yay-nay-abstain. Make the results available to everyone: Congress, the media, the public. Let's see if our Representatives agree with their constituents.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Many citizens ignore what happens in Congress because it is too removed from their daily life. Even if one is chosen only once a year to participate in a poll on how Congress should vote on a bill, that is far more engagement than most people enjoy today.</div><br />	drwtwilner	-12	9	21	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2908-4049	
2909-4049	Cost versus benefit	2009-05-22 00:00:00	Every department, every regulation, every statute, every process in government is undertaken with the assumption that the benefits outweigh the costs. The truth is, the ratio between benefits and costs varies from more than 1,000,000:1 to less than 1:1,000,000. In pursuit of transparency, let every department publish, once a year, a statement of benefits versus costs. While I hold little hope that the numbers will be accurate, there should still be a trillion-fold difference between the best and the worst. What people do with these numbers remains to be seen, but I am hoping that the thousand worst will be discontinued.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Government programs ultimately descend into self-preservation, using resources without producing benefits.

If one were able to vote on anything, or alternatively assign one's votes on particular subject areas to someone else they trust to vote wisely, then one could have confidence that their vote is most aligned with their intent.

2913-4049	Limit IRS Regulation to 100 Pages	2009-05-22 00:00:00	Our nation's schoolchildren abide such rules everyday--so why is government allowed to fill libraries with the mind-numbingly complex literature that is income tax law? Congress must scrap the existing income tax regulation in favor of something the American public, even they themselves, can read. As was shown by the tax-code embarrassments of Timothy Geithner and Kathleen Sebelius, even the authors of our income tax laws find them utterly unreadable.<br /><br />America needs to have a tax code it can read within a week, not several lifetimes. The fact that a billion-dollar industry that revolves solely around completing your income taxes for you is shameful and reflective of the government-sponsored confusion the IRS has created.<br /><br />Furthermore, simplifying the income tax system will reap benefits for the American people and business. Even the IRS stands to gain, as it can more easily find the true tax evaders, not just the innocent ones who misread a bit of the legalese. Small-business owners will no longer lose valuable time sifting through complex taxation literature or have to pay their entire profit to a company like H&R; Block. By streamlining the income tax, it will be a second stimulus to small businesses across America.<br /><br />What I advocate is none less than an extension of these criticisms:<br />-Whether it be through Congressional legislation or by Geither if he as such authority over the IRS (which I doubt) is to publish a document, 100 pages, double spaced and in 12-point Times New Roman, that contains the full form of income taxes for the individual and business. <br />-If Congressional action is required, then make it clear that this is not a subversive method of raising taxes. Do not touch tax rates. However, the well-concealed loopholes manipulated by the petrochemicals industry and big-businesses will have to be dropped to fit the length limit.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea is important because it will correct the abuse-ridden income tax system and allow Americans nationwide to understand the forms they are completing.</div><br />	esoltas	23	29	6	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2913-4049	
2915-4049	Address Semantic Web 3.0 Interoperability First!	2009-05-22 00:00:00	Extensive analysis inside DoD, DHS and DoE over the past 8 years has validated the need for the use of Semantic Web 3.0 Technology applied to specific problems that currently cost taxpayers Billions. Web2 has proven it does not cut it. Web2 does not take advantage of existing GIG ontologies that ensure secure interoperability, nor does it interface with the DoD Metadata Registry.<br /><br />DoD Intel agencies have prove the use of DARPA initiated Semantic Web3 technology in Intelligence applications for years. To apply Web3 to management issues, such as Transparency, first requires the development of a special community of practice geared around interoperability. Examples such as NCOIC.org can serve as an example that addresses the complexity involved and can possibly accommodate these issues into their existing working groups.<br /><br />Until a path for Semantic Web3 interoperability has been established, Open Govt concepts described in this Dialogue will be stuck in the usual IT quagmire with its share of GAO Reports and IT Budget over runs. Given that Mr. Kundra lacks SemWeb experience, its imperative that the CFO.gov council take the lead in developing a Semantic Interoperability subcommittee to coordinate with industry and focus industry's feedback in clear English.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Semantic Interoperability is the essential first step. Execution requires a multi-agency effort and a CRADA, such as the one employed by NCOIC with DISA. The CIO Kundra "doesn't know what he doesn't know" about this New Critical Paradigm shift. Web3 is not just a buzzword. Its the start of a new era in computing that embodies the best of Web2 and improves upon it.<br /><br />It begins by encoding data in a new Triples format and grows from there to enable valuable new capabilities not affordable in Web2.<br />Success requires learning new skills, tools, and vocabulary to navigate the issues at the highest levels. Ability to understand and execute the New Paradigm Web3 will be the biggest determinant of Mr. Kundra's success as CIO.</div><br />	info	3	6	3	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2915-4049	
2916-4049	NEPA: turn the writing of the EIS into an "open-book" process.	2009-05-22 00:00:00	NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) was designed with an unusual attention to public participation (unusual for 1970 that is!). Web 2.0 provides more ways to distribute information and to involve affected communities in the NEPA process. This gives us an opportunity to increase public participation in the NEPA process and improve the outcomes. <br />NEPA requires public review at 3 specific points in the preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Because of the length of time required for many EISs, these public review points (scoping, draft EIS and final EIS) can be separated by many months, and, in cases where the project is controversial, lots of pressure can build up in the intervening months that can make the public meetings confrontational and unproductive.<br />Instead of restricting public input to these three events, what if the EIS was compiled as an open book? How would it work if, for example, the drafting process started with a published frame-work, published draft chapters as and when they were written, received and displayed comments as the drafting progressed and reflected the comments in the text, inserted research results as they become available, etc. etc? I've seen some of this already (e.g. research results published as soon as they are available, an additional public meeting inserted between the DEIS and the FEIS, public comments accepted after the close of the comment periods, etc.) and this seemed to add to the sense of involvement and certainly reduced the tension and drama of the public meetings. So why not write it in the open?<br />I'm sure that this will present some substantial challenges. I've never had to write an EIS, and would like to hear from you if you have. What would the challenges be?<br />What do others think?<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The process of writing Environmental Impact Statements under NEPA is designed to be a process that opens itself to public input, so that the quality and legitimacy of its outcomes depend on meaningful public involvement. However, it was designed in 1969 when the opportunities for effective public input were quite different from the opportunities that we enjoy 40 years later. In these four decades the expectations for public involvement have also changed. If the public involvement process fails to develop to respond to these increased expectations, and to take advantage of these improved public involvement opportunities, the outcomes of the NEPA review process risk losing legitimacy and quality.</div><br />	Nicholas Dewar	17	20	3	5	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2916-4049	
2917-4049	Citizens' elections security online tracking tool and restoration forum	2009-05-22 00:00:00	Several websites and organizations compile information about the security (or lack there of) of Fed, state, & local elections laws & protocols -- chain of custody, ballot access, voter registration security. This info is spread out, and often so specific that it is only accessed by and decipherable to "elections buffs." The constituents most in need of secure elections, and most capable of forcing their representatives to amend current practices, are left without a large but decipherable body of information, as well as user-friendly tools to that assist them in their efforts at increasing elections security.<br /><br />Rather than attempt to legislate costly top-down change (which VP Biden has opposed), create some type of framework into which volunteers (or elections officials) can dump/fill in data that visually illustrates the ballot chain of custody -- from Constitutional guarantee of their right to vote, to ballot printing, to vote counting procedure and machine software security, to recount procedures, final storage and eventual disposal.<br /><br />An interactive time line-like illustration of the chain of custody would be ideal. Users can consult elections law to "fill out" the chain, with discussion forum threads accompany each step. Users can discuss/debate the best options and rate the vulnerability of their vote at that stage in the elections process -- a color-grade scale (yellow to red, to illustrate areas of greatest need and concern.) Threads will be cross-referenced to similar topics/issues in other localities, so that, for instance, Palm Beach County Florida users can investigate and discuss the cheapest and most secure non re-sealable adhesive ballot seals, with Orange County California users faced with the same problem. The tool can similarly be utilized by municipalities to assist each other -- once an open debate and investigation has identified the most secure and cost efficient option, Palm Beach and Orange County might combine their purchases to reduce costs.<br /><br />The tool can become a great classroom civics project for students, where the class will dedicate itself to learning the necessity and means of maintaining secure elections, while getting hands-on experience working with their local government as pro-active civic participants (even if it does entail something as simple as researching adhesive stickers.) Students will learn to investigate a problem, find a solution, and how to present it to an elected official so that its value is undeniable, and their efforts deliver real world results.<br /><br />This online tool would be best served by hosting it at the Sunlight Foundation's OpenCongress website, which already has an audience of involved citizens. Because the website is heavily user-driven, once the coding is written, the website/tool and the community using it, will largely take care of itself -- this is a very small investment with a very large return.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This tool will improve elections security, educate citizens about the security of their elections and involve citizens and their children in their elections and local government. It will also aid in collaboration between local, state and federal government, and assist governments in reducing the cost of elections.</div><br />	carrick.baugh	1	5	4	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2917-4049	
2920-4049	Tool for tracking personal news/media consumption habits, and ownership of those outlets	2009-05-22 00:00:00	The Columbia Schools of Journalism already keeps a listing of print and broadcast media, and its ownership status. Expand this to include Internet sources, and allow users to track and record their 'consumption habits.' Users can then see if 80% of their news and information is coming from the same parent company, what percentage of their information comes from big media companies and how much is smaller-scale or independent journalism/media.<br /><br />Using existing data from broadcasters, users can select the programs they watch (NBC Nightly News, NPR Fresh Air, Bill O'Reilly, Democracy Now, Daily Show) and read (Drudge Report, The Daily Beast, Financial Times, Washington Post), and be provided with a pie charts and graphs illustrating the ownership and diversity of the sources that inform their opinions.<br /><br />This would be a pretty simple idea to execute, and might be done by simply working with Columbia to expand their current project. It would be ideal to host it on an expanded Fed, State and Local OpenCongress-style Sunlight Foundation page, where users can come to learn about and influence their government. An extremely cheap and easily developed tool, with great benefits.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It helps people identify how diverse their information sources may or may not be, and also the extent to which their opinions are shaped by organizations with mutual financial interests.

I would then like to be invited to contact that elected official and comment on their vote.<br /><br />If the idea here is to increase participation and increase transparency, I think the main thing that detracts me, and I assume others, is that I do not have the time to track all the moves my elected officials make. If my elected official votes or otherwise influences policy that I have an opinion about, I would like the opportunity to weigh in by communicating to that person or someone representing that elected official.<br /><br />Ways to expand this project/concept would be to track and compile voting histories for elected officials.

2929-4049	"MyGov.gov" --> Customized to What Affects YOU	2009-05-23 00:00:00	When you create an employment profile at USAjobs.gov, an email-alert will be sent to you when it finds a federal job vacancy that matches your profile. You don't do the job searching -- the job vacancy "finds" you.<br /><br />But we should create a broader system -- "MyGov.gov" -- that looks over ALL those government proposals (e.g., policies, programs, projects) that match what YOU indicate would be of interest to YOU. And when there's a match, you get an email about it. For example:<br /><br />Is a new highway exit being proposed near you? --> MyGov.gov alerts you about the public hearings.<br /><br />Does someone want a wind-turbine close by? --> MyGov.gov tells you about the permit application.<br /><br />A regulation proposed that would affect your business? --> MyGov.gov sends you the public notice.<br /><br />Every one of us has special interests in certain things that our government does (or might do). Therefore, we need to set up a modern notification system ("MyGov.gov") that sends an email-message when YOUR special interests might be affected by a specific government proposal.<br /><br />Actually, there IS a "notification system" that's been around for decades. It's called the "Federal Register", but it does a poor job of notifying the average citizen about public proposals and plans of the U.S. government.<br /> <br />Every week, the Federal Register publishes hundreds of public notices from federal departments and agencies asking the public (that means you) to give them feedback on their proposals for doing their govt. work. But even though the Federal Register is now online, it can takes hours every day to determine if any of it might affect you.<br /><br />And that is why we need "MyGov.gov" -- the customized government portal to YOU. <br /><br />respectfully,<br />Stephen Buckley<br />http://www.UStransparency.com<br /><br />P.S. "MyGov.gov" would be similar to the "MyRegulations" concept being considered under Regulations.gov (but it would be limited to *regulations*, not actual projects like highways, bridges, wind-turbines, etc.).<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Given the present system, it is understandable why most people are NOT properly notified about the opportunities to participate in the decisionmaking of federal agencies. AND if they don't know what's going on, then they can't participate.

It is fast, centralized, accurate, convenient, and much less expensive than current practices using voting machines with paper ballots and lots of people power in each state.<br /><br />Each voter would receive by USPS mail or by email during account setup a unique key code that is entered on the phone or web page login, and that key is applied to each vote that is cast.<br /><br />There could be a central database for all local, state, and national elections.

2932-4049	Local forums to implement high-speed networks (broadband)	2009-05-23 00:00:00	Municipalities and regions undertaking projects in high-speed<br />networking be encouraged to create online forums that:<br /><br />* Post regional maps showing the demographic features, geographical<br />features, patterns of network use, and technological facilities<br />relevant to the project<br /><br />* Accept proposals, provide comment and rating systems, and run polls<br /><br />* Provide public terminals and low-bandwidth versions of data, so that<br />people who are currently on the disadvantaged side of the digital<br />divide can offer input to help cross that divide<br /><br />* Are supplemented by face-to-face gatherings<br /><br />* Collaborate with newspapers and with television and radio news<br />programs to publicize proposals, meetings, and opportunities for<br />public comment<br /><br />* Create visitor accounts, perhaps with validation procedures for<br />determining local residence, and allow visitors to identify their<br />expertise and credentials<br /><br />* Provide tools for mapping proposed facilities and for calculating<br />the reach, bandwidth, and costs of proposed facilities<br /><br />* Provide data about ongoing deployments in standardized, open formats<br />on maps and in downloadable form<br /><br />The federal-level initiative can support these efforts by:<br /><br />* Mandating the types of information that participating municipalities<br />and companies should provide, such as the capabilities of current<br />facilities, statistics on current usage, demographic information such<br />as income and connectivity on a neighborhood basis, and detailed<br />implementation plans with measurable milestones<br /><br />* Funding the development of software tools, such as programs that can<br />estimate the quality of wireless coverage for different terrains, or<br />the time period required to recoup the costs of building out networks<br /><br />* Providing formats and quality standards for the data provided<br /><br />* Publicizing successful initiatives, the tools they used, and their<br />best practices<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>High-speed digital networking (also known as "broadband") should<br />concern open government advocates in two ways.<br /><br />First, one of the Administration's major goals is to bring high-speed<br />networking to every resident of the country.<br /><br />Second, this goal is fundamental to the other goals in the Memorandum<br />on Transparency and Open Government. Members of the public need<br />continuous access to the Internet and the ability to handle video and<br />sophisticated graphical displays in order to make full use of the<br />resources provided in open government efforts.<br /><br />Why do I stress the local nature of these forums?<br /><br />All networking is (on one level) local. Given the limited resources<br />available for any network deployment, and the trade-offs that must be<br />made during plans, decision-makers need to take into account local<br />demographics, geography, topology, social and economic priorities, and<br />existing facilities. Here are just a few examples the many local<br />issues typically considered:<br /><br />- Which neighborhoods are already relatively well-served or poorly<br />served<br /><br />- Where it's cost-effective to string fiber, versus serving a<br />neighborhood through a high-bandwidth wireless solution<br /><br />- Whether there are existing facilities and lines that could be<br />repurposed or upgraded for high-speed networking<br /><br />- How many public funds to invest and which private firms to contract<br />with to provide infrastructure or Internet service<br /><br />- Whether a non-essential service, such as wireless for spots where<br />tourists or businesspeople congregate, could generate enough new jobs<br />or revenue to be worth an investment<br /><br />- What public and private partners and sources of investment are<br />available<br /><br />- Whether people in potential new markets have the desire and<br />education to use new network services, and how to create the<br />conditions under which the populations would use the services<br /><br />Innumerable issues like these require local knowledge and judgment.<br />That is why many innovative and successful initiatives to provide<br />digital networks have been launched by local governments or local<br />private service providers.<br /><br />Local collaboration to promote network penetration can also build<br />bonds that support local communities in other ways. The global reach<br />of the Internet has long been stressed, but the role of digital<br />networks in connecting people within geographical communities and<br />improving their way of life may be even more important and is<br />beginning to be recognized.<br /><br />Although complex, the issues are no more complex than many other<br />issues being considered for implementation of the open government<br />directive. With proper organization and support, community members<br />could make these decisions and monitor their implementation.<br /><br />Local community forums also attract participants more easily than<br />geographically distributed "communities of interest." People are<br />likely to respond to the invitations of friends and neighbors, and to<br />be more loyal to the forums when they know the participants<br />personally. So local forums are good ways to initiate the general<br />public to the notion of transparent and participatory governance.<br /><br />A note on current federal broadband initiatives<br /><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) includes a Broadband<br />Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), operated through the NTIA,<br />that creates a 4.7-billion-dollar program to promote broadband,<br />particularly for unserved areas and populations.<br /><br />The implementation does not involve any of the innovative aspects of<br />the open government directive, such as collaborative online forums and<br />data exposed through open formats and APIs. Like other programs in<br />ARRA, the focus on providing a fast economic stimulus led to a<br />schedule that does not accommodate time to set up and accept comments<br />in this manner. A public comment period was held from March 12 to<br />April 13, 2009, and proposals must be submitted by September 2009.<br /><br />The FCC adopted the goal of expanding broadband access many years ago,<br />and cites this goal in many opinions concerning competition. The FCC<br />also continues to offer funds for broadband under the Universal<br />Service Fund (USF), which was expanded by the 1996 Telecommunications Act to<br />include Internet access. The USF does not involve public online forums<br />or open data access.<br /><br />The FCC also plans to publish a national broadband plan by February<br />2010. Because the funds from BTOP will probably be disbursed by then,<br />this plan could be a locus for the kinds of forums describes in this<br />proposal.<br /><br />Quick disclaimer: broadband adoption is hard to measure--it depends on<br />such fuzz factors as the minimum speed defined as "broadband," the<br />difference between potential and usual speeds, and uncertainties about<br />actual availability versus official penetration rates--but recent<br />estimates suggest that half of the United States population has<br />always-on, high-speed network access. Although this reflects a<br />substantial increase in recent years, it still leaves the US behind<br />many other developed nations. Further improvements will require more<br />intensive planning and careful resource allocation, as we try to<br />extend adoption to populations with fewer resources or geographical<br />challenges.<br /><br />Summary of benefits:<br /><br />* When the public can evaluate the options available to their<br />community and the trade-offs required, they can reach agreement on a<br />digital networking policy that reflects the values of many<br />constituents and communities.<br /><br />* Tools for measuring the impacts of different proposals can help<br />everyone in the community agree on what trade-offs exist, and provide<br />a factual basis for decision-making.<br /><br />* Technically trained members of the community can use the measurement<br />and visualization tools on the forum to educate those who are less<br />technically sophisticated and ensure that everyone has the opportunity<br />to make valid and appropriate input.<br /><br />* Progress in implementation can be followed by the public, who can<br />demand accountability in spending and results.<br /><br />* Collaboration in building local networks can lead to continued<br />collaboration in using those networks to improve economic,<br />educational, and policy initiatives in the communities. They can also<br />give visitors the skills and interests to join larger, national<br />efforts in fulfillment of the Memorandum on Transparency and Open<br />Government,<br /><br />* Standardization and information sharing between communities can help<br />later communities reach successful conclusions more quickly and with<br />less wasted effort.<br /><br />* Finally, the public participation fostered by local forums can<br />educate the public about telecommunications issues that have a<br />national or even international scope, such as expanding major access<br />points, fostering technological innovation, and changing national<br />policies and laws.<br /><br /></div><br />	Andrew Oram	28	31	3	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2932-4049

There are no unclassified documents held by the government that should not be available free to the public for electronic download (and probably many that are which should be also). If you look, you will find that the costs of securing and accounting for online document data sales often exceed the revenue that such sales generate.

In many cases, the meetings are already 'open to the public' - if you are in Washington, D.C., and you register in advance, and you get there early enough to get a seat in overcrowded meeting rooms. But this is the 21st Century, and web cams cost $20, not $20,000. For less than a board spends to air condition its meeting chambers over the course of a year, its meetings can be webcast to anyone interested in its proceedings. This would prompt greater public participation in regulatory decision making, and help free many agences from captive control by lobbyists for the industries they regulate. Perpetual archiving of all such meetings - gavel to gavel - would provide valuable evidence in court where decisions are challenged as capricious (or unduly influenced) by parties victimized by such decisions.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Many agencies employ court stenographers to document these meetings, a cost easily saved by the electronic video record (which can be machine transcribed for free at any later date that a written record is desired).</div><br />	david.wenbert	21	28	7	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2936-4049	
2937-4049	Crowd-Source the Federal Grant Selection Process	2009-05-23 00:00:00	The legendary Sen. William Proxmire's (D-WI) "Golden Fleece Award" famously documented cases of questionable, exotic, and, sometimes, downright bizarre instances of federal funds - generally research grants - wasted on projects of dubious merit. Of course, now we have the Digital Environment. Crowdsource the grant selection process among qualifying applicants, and let the taxpayers and other stakeholders (i.e. cancer patients for cancer studies, zoologists on wildlife, etc.) choose from among the competing submissions. This will bring a vital measure of "Common Sense" to the process, often elusive to pointy headed bureaucrats in Washington, weeding out the most 'obviously silly' in favor of projects more generally agreed to be worthwhile. In most cases, the aggregate wisdom of the general public should be quite adequate to make the selection (without predjudice, favoritism or influence peddling), while in highly technical subject areas, the choice could be crowdsourced among a more focused audience, drawn from the appropriate professional technical societies relevant to the discipline. For example, the depth of knowledge of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, American Nurses Association, National Education Association - and many others in other fields - could be harnessed, enabling their members to review and vote onilne as to which federal research grant proposals best advance the state-of-the-art in their respective disciplines.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>To this day, Members of Congress have no difficulty in citing ongoing abusive examples of such waste, and no institutional mechanism yet exists within the government to reign it in.</div><br />	david.wenbert	7	11	4	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2937-4049	
2938-4049	Generate Crosscutting Thematic Bitstreams	2009-05-23 00:00:00	We're still addressing problems in the 21st Century with bureaucracies designed in the 1930s. But contemporary issues like Transgenerational Poverty, Environmental Energy, Preventive Wellness, and Early Childcare do not fit neatly into the vertical departmental boxes drawn decades ago. The number of interagency task forces and interdepartmental agreements endeavoring to tackle such issues has mushroomed in recent years, and yet the struggles between parochial fiefdoms remain, inhibiting those federal workers 'down in the trenches' who would actually solve these problems if given half a chance. Use inexpensive digital video and web 2.0 tools to create crosscutting thematic bitstreams (video, audio, data, documents) which channelize enterprise (govt) wide content to specific interdisciplinary problems (i.e. "Poverty"). As viewers and co-producers of such a channel, agents anywhere within the federal government (and, ultimately, state and local governments, and NGOs) can contribute information content to be shared among all other participants with cognizance over the problem for their particular agencies. Emerging inexpensive digital media appliances, such as the second generation [.mp4 video capable, WiFi enabled] Digital Picture Frame (under $50) now empower users to move continuous vidstreams off their working Windows Desktop, taking them to the Physical Desktop instead - where real estate is now at less of a premium. More importantly, these cheap, addressable displays can be taken home, or to lunch, or on the road, wherever WiFi service exists, to download and play the streams waiting for any given individual, permitting the content to be watched 24/7. Channellized collaborative content input, on interdisciplinary and interdepartmental themes can more effectively disseminate institutional knowledge, establish stakeholder 'buy-in' for proposed initiatives, and eliminate knowledge gaps which lead to inertia, dissention, inaction, and conflict.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It would eliminate duplication between agencies and allow them to more coherently address complex issues.</div><br />	david.wenbert	7	8	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2938-4049	
2939-4049	Create an Employee DNA Databank for Epigenetic Research	2009-05-23 00:00:00	The federal government represents the largest body of individuals within the same health maintenance framework in the western world. The Administration's emphasis on digital medical records and 'Health IT' can easily be taken One Small Step further with the comprehensive personal genome sequencing of every federal employee, and the use of this database by the NIH in its ongoing quest to understand the epigenetic factors underlying many diseases. Decoding the Human Genome was the first step, which taught us that the role of genetics in health is far more complex than previously imagined. Recent discovery of the sixth human nucleotide proves that only through the accumulation of a genome library of massive numbers of people - correlated with their medical histories and responses to treatment - can the most important secrets of diseases (and aging) be understood well enough to permit universally effective cures to be developed. The potential cures which the NIH and other medical researchers worldwide could develop from the analysis of this data is of incalculable value. Not only would the addition of personal genomes to the federal personnel medical records be of immense benefit to federal employees (particularly in their later years), the federal commitment to do so would drive down the cost of practical personal gene sequencing by orders of magnitude, making it available for everyone.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Meanwhile you would effectively establish the 'Gold Standard' for the capture and security of personal genetic information which would become the new baseline for handling such data throughout the healthcare, insurance, and human resources industries.</div><br />	david.wenbert	-25	2	27	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2939-4049

Millions of pages of scientific papers, proposals, studies, reports, etc. lie fallow, either becaue they preceeded the digital age or have foundered in the backwaters of the labyrinth, with no one to champion their relevance in the 21st Century. Empower each agency (deep down into the bureaucracy, practically to the individual program level) to designate its own Cognitive Archivist, charged solely with the responsibility for assimilating the prior institutional knowledge base toward the extraction of prospectively useful recovered data and 'lessons learned' which may assist the organization in more effectively accomplishing its mission in the future. Since the federal workforce is considerably older than that of the private sector, and will undergo wholesale changeout of personnel (estimated at 600,000) in the next few years, this initiative to build and protect a worker-independent institutional memory should receive a significant high priority from the new Administration. Perhaps more importantly, the Cognitive Archivist can develop these information resources into new knowledge-based services for their agency's user community, academia, and industry at large.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It is likely that the preponderance of societal value obtainable from the aggregate federal document collection has yet to extracted from it.</div><br />	david.wenbert	13	13	0	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2940-4049	
2941-4049	Digital 'Federal Academy of Science & Technology'	2009-05-23 00:00:00	In 1995, the Western Governor's Association established a bipartisan interstate compact to establish Western Governor's University, an open-entry, all digital, accredited online institution of higher learning. It offers Bachelors and Masters Degrees in Teaching, Nursing, Business, and Information Technology, with no barriers to admission, in an accelerated self-paced format driven by competency milestones rather than 'seat time'. Liberated of brick-and-mortar overhead, it provides a cost effective highly personalized university experience to tens of thousands of students from all 50 states. The enormous body of science and engieering data over which the federal IT establishment has custody is potentially the world's largest educational resource. Moreover, the dozen or so universities already owned by the federal government (from National Defense University to the Service Academies to the USDA Grad School) are all working to tranform themselves into 21st Century institutions, by bringing their course material online and enabling their students to access digital courseware from other institutions. A new, all-digital university [a virtual "Federal Academy of Science & Technology"] could be organized from latent federal information resources in science, engineering and technology, providing universal low-cost access to specialized Associates, Masters, and Doctoral programs, on a basis which is noncompetitve with - and nonthreatening to - the existing [Bachelors-based] university establishment. With annuitous tuition income as an after-hours bonus incentive, many federal employees could be enticed to utilize their in-depth knowledge of the information spectrum to create specific courseware from it, itemized to the structure of various master curricula professionally developed by domain experts in the selected disciplines.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This is a far less expensive approach to rapidly spreading college education among those who cannot afford current tuition to traditional institutions.

While dead-tree publishing is rapidly becoming obsolete, the need for in-house specialty publishing houses for niche market econometric research has long been obviated by the rise of new cottage data industries in virtually every field imaginable. Today, the federal government could profitably sell off the BLS, EIA, and several other such internal specialty publishing houses, and invest the billions of dollars in capital it would recover to permanently endow an American Knowledge Institute [along the lines of the National Endowments for the Arts or Humanities]. Such a foundation would pursue the interdisciplinary and inter-institutional assimilation of knowledge in the rapidly accelerating and ever-more-pervasive Digital Environment. In addition to assimilating the vast trove of little known, seldom used federal document data, in ways as described above, an American Knowledge Institute could employ emerging techniques in Artificial Intelligence to analytically exploit the USPTO Patent Library, the MS Thesis/PhD Dissertation collections of all universities in the United States (and, potentially, worldwide), and the rapidly expanding Google Books scanned digital collection.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The new knowledge synthesis which might occur from such an initiative, while unpredictable in scope, would be of a magnitude comparable to advent of the printing press or the internet itself.</div><br />	david.wenbert	1	7	6	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2942-4049

2950-4049	Create performance measures that help the public consider resource allocation decisions 	2009-05-23 00:00:00	Federal Departments' strategic goals and performance measures are often too difficult to interpret. We should fix this. Citizens who wish to provide guidance to their elected officials about spending priorities struggle to understand the basic objectives of programs and their actual progress. The tendency for performance measures to be vague, and goals perpetually met, is easily understood in the context of the federal budgeting process, where every Department wants to grow or at least maintain its budgets and staff, and where accurate performance measures come with fear of budget cuts if performance falls. It may also explain why these measures are buried in lengthy budget documents and ExpectMore.gov contains only a few programs and no overarching structure to understand how the rated programs fit into the broader budget. <br /><br />But if we want to make difficult choices about spending, we need new communications about performance, web 2.0 if that's we want to call it, which clearly link spending to strategic goals and help citizens make those difficult choices. This may require some new technology or data, but really, it requires a sea change in the way our government views its people. Are we a capricious and irresponsible bunch, susceptible to messaging and rose-tinted statistics, easily managed with proper polling and sufficient advertising? Or are we a resource for guidance and direction, offering the wisdom of crowds, government of the people by the people as our founders called it, to the difficult question of how best to cut spending while actually improving benefits to the public?<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>When citizens better understand the intended purpose of federal spending, they are better equipped to compare trade-offs between funding proposals and engage in the process of governing--making difficult choices democratically, rather than leaving it to beleaguered elected officials who feel compelled to spend irresponsibly for political survival, or special interests who wield influence for narrow monetary gain. However, one difficulty with performance metrics is that federal departments tend to choose numbers that are difficult to decipher, or goals that lack ambition. For example, one of The Department of Transportation's performance metrics for traffic congestion is "Percent of total annual urban-area travel time occurring in congested condition," and the Department's goal is 27.1%. I don't know how this is measured exactly, I do know that the Department reports this number as falling in recent years, which does not match my personal experience, nor the experience of most fellow citizens stuck in traffic that is bad and getting worse. So how then can we as citizens, provide insight on whether related programs deserve more or less funding, when the metrics chosen for us are abstract, and seemingly designed to obfuscate rather than inform? I believe engaging citizens in resource allocation decisions, reflecting their informed consideration of the likelihood of certain programs achieving well-defined objectives, is essential to creating a federal government that meets its citizens needs without borrowing so irresponsibly against its future. But if success metrics are going to contribute to this, Washington's interpretation of what those metrics are and what they deliver must be reexamined. The centerpiece of all performance measures should be engaging citizens in decision-making rather than informing them of "progress" that rarely jives with actual experience.</div><br />	ryan.tuggle	23	24	1	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2950-4049

And the best way to do this is through participant dialogue.<br /><br />I propose a series of dialogue topics for the many discussion groups already formed and interested in working together to change the direction the world is heading. I call this series, The Process of Illumination (POI), looking at the way we see things. The theme is, The minute you make up your mind that the way you see things makes a difference, it will make a difference in the way you see things --- and do things. Seeing things with a more open and inclusive mindset will lead to more working together and seeking common ground. <br /><br />My latest POI article is posted below. Other POI articles can be reviewed on my website, www.gelattpartners.com. <br /><br />COLLABORATION MAKES YOU SMARTER<br />Two Heads Are Better Than One<br />H B Gelatt <br /><br />None of us is as smart as all of us. Kenneth Blanchard<br /><br />In his 1992 book, Discovering Common Ground, Marvin Weisbord's main theme was that "the world was moving from experts solving problems FOR people, toward everybody, experts included, improving whole systems." He said he believed this was the best strategy if you want long-term dignity, meaning and community. It seems like once again we are moving toward that but not there yet. <br /><br />Recently President Obama was representing the United States at the G-20 Summit Meeting in London. This is where 20 nations were working together trying to solve the global economic crisis. "To work together" is one definition of collaboration. Obama is an experienced community worker, and he thinks like one, seeking common ground and promoting collective action. <br /><br />In my opinion the Bush administration was an example of experts authoritatively, unilaterally solving problems for people (and for other nations) while the Obama administration is an example of involving everybody (and other nations) in collaborate decision making for improving whole systems. Although we don't yet know the results of the current collaborative administration, we do know the results of the previous unilateral administration.<br /><br />In a 2008 book, The Necessary Revolution by Peter Senge and others, the subtitle is: A guidebook for those who recognize the need to act and work together --- now. They present examples of organizations working collaboratively across boundaries, creating pathways that enable them to flourish in an increasingly interdependent world. <br /><br />John Zogby in The Way We'll Be,2008 lists some of the characteristics of the new "Global Generation" --- a broader worldview in general, heighten social awareness, genuine appreciation for diversity and multiculturalism, the most outward-looking and accepting generation in American history, more devoted to finding common ground on tough social issues. <br /> <br />Because of these global, organizational and personal trends, it is possible to be optimistic about the direction the world is heading. This article is about collaboration and it is part of my Process of Illumination (POI), promoting a more open and inclusive worldview <br /><br />The strategy I propose is to recognize that self-interest and other-Interest are reciprocal (Marilyn Ferguson), which involves collaboration, common ground, and collective action. Someday I think we will see collaboration, instead of competition, as a sign of competence. Let's look for more examples of working together --- in order to expand our optimism about the world's future direction and our involvement in it. <br /><br />See Self-interest and Other-Interest as Reciprocal. <br />Reciprocal self-interest and other interest is sometimes called "enlightened self-interest" If everything is connected, as the new sciences tell us, then every nation, organization, group and even every individual is connected, even democrats and republicans, rich people and poor people, you and me, etc. If we can see everything as connected, yet see ourselves as ignorant of most of the connections, then we are more likely to be tolerant toward ourselves and others, and more compassionate, cooperative and collaborative. We would want to collaborate rather than compete. We would…<br /><br />• See more interconnectedness <br />No nation, organization or person is an island. Therefore working together is better than working in isolation for nations, organizations, and individuals, even for political parties.<br /><br />Try to think of examples where your organization or group was or will be better by working together with others. Or find a personal example when collaboration with someone else (two heads instead of one) was or will be helpful. What examples of political parties or nations working together come to mind? <br /><br />• Get a second and third opinion<br />It seems obvious that no one of us is as smart as all of us. If you can't get everyone's opinion, get some that are different than yours. Since it is easier to give advice than take advice, we usually don't have much practice getting advice, let alone taking it. <br /><br />Think of examples when someone's advice was very helpful to you or to others when making important decisions. Getting and using advice is even harder for most groups, organizations or political parties because of their dominance of self-interests. What examples of enlighten self-interest come to mind? <br /><br />• Imagine long-term consequences<br />Interconnectedness means that the future is connected to the present and the past. What happened yesterday influences today and what happens today influences tomorrow and future tomorrows. The problem with what we do today is that we will never experience some of it's consequences in the future. And we will never even know the consequential experiences of others.<br /><br />Try to visualize or imagine the possible consequences of your actions in the present. This again is where collaboration with others, getting different opinions, is helpful. You can't see the future but you can imagine it. Be careful of the tendency to see what you want to see and not see what you don't want to see.<br /><br />What Do You Think?<br />1. Does the evidence (from Bush to Obama administration; the new Global Generation, and other evidence) justify optimism? Why? Why not? <br />2. Can we identify other optimistic and/or pessimistic trends? <br />3. Is seeing self-interest and other-interest as reciprocal an unrealistic strategy? A good idea but it won't work? Why not? What strategy will work? <br />4. Is the world is moving from experts solving problems for people, toward everybody improving whole systems.? Can you give examples of yes or no? <br /><br />By H B Gelatt, e-mail: hb@gelattpartners.com<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>"Our minds are the source, and properly directed, the solution to all our problems."

In one case, an additional $50,000 plus an additional year to implement kept a Virtual Institute at one government institution from being launch 2 years ago. The professional development program for K-12 teachers at this institution is just now getting off of the ground, but had suffered greatly because of this process. The vision of this project is now a small piece of what it could have been two years ago and what it could be now â&euro;&ldquo; innovative. I support such processes as long as they focus on a realistic process that is not cumbersome, costly, or discouraging.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It opens the door to innovation!</div><br />	cjennings	-1	2	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2960-4049	
2961-4049	Research and share best practices for targeted outreach to involve more than the usual suspects in public decision making	2009-05-23 00:00:00	As Marcella has pointed out in an earlier post, one of the biggest and most important challenges facing anyone seeking to create a meaningful public engagement process is how to include more than "the usual suspects" in public decision making. Typically underrepresented groups of people in public decision making and planning include immigrants, renters, young families, teens, people with low or no income, disabled or differently-abled people, people with limited English language skills, etc. It takes significant forethought and investment of time and resources to effectively involve these underrepresented demographics in a truly inclusive process that brings all voices affected by a decision or plan to the table. <br /><br />There is a need for research to identify and share the best practices in the outreach and implementation stages of public engagement. Specifically, what are the best practices for reaching out to and including specific underrepresented groups of people? I have conducted research on best practices for including immigrants and Latino Americans in public meetings, and I encourage others to fund, conduct, and share similar research projects in order that we as a nation might build our capacity for a more democratic and participatory system that represents everyone's voice. <br /><br />While I am very impressed and thankful that the Obama administration is making this effort to explore new opportunities for deliberative public engagement, I am concerned that there seems to be such a heavy emphasis on online interaction and input. While this technology can certainly be a great way to get lots of people in communication, it tends to leave out many of the underrepresented groups of people I listed above. We need a variety of different models and opportunities for public engagement to remove as many barriers as possible to broad participation for all of us affected by important government decisions.<br /><br />You can read about strategies for including immigrants in civic engagement efforts in "A Local Official's Guide to Immigrant Civic Engagement," available for free download from the Institute for Local Government at www.ca-ilg.org/cgi<br /><br />I also worked on a research project for the nonprofit AmericaSpeaks on best strategies for including Latino Americans in deliberative democracy. The findings are published in the Winter 2008 issue of the National Civic Review, please email me at gregkeidan@gmail.com for a copy.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>If a public engagement effort doesn't include all voices affected by the decision or plan,<br />1) People who were left out may rise up to oppose implementation of the plan or decision that is made.<br />2) Smart elected leaders will discount the results of this expensive public engagement process because they will realize it does not represent the will of all of their constituents.<br />3) Typically underrepresented groups of people will continue to be under-served by government, as elected officials will continue to be out of touch with the needs, desires, and potential contributions of these parts of the population.</div><br />	gregkeidan	50	54	4	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2961-4049	
2962-4049	Web 2.0 Literacy	2009-05-23 00:00:00	What strategies might be employed to adopt greater use of Web 2.0 in agencies? <br /><br />Intelligence of the technology - from k-12, higher education, and government agencies. Start from the ground up! Media and Technology literacy is disturbing, because many do not know the usefulness of the technologies available and many that do misuse the technologies. For example, how many workers in our agencies know about Blogs or can accurately define one? Additionally, of those who use Blogs regularly, how many of them have an editorial process in place to ensure that the information they post is accurate? Intelligence in knowing and use is key. Education and processes of use must be in place regardless of the Web2.0 technology being used.<br /><br />What is the best way to change the culture of government to embrace collaboration? <br /><br />This is a good start - ask for it and give people time out of their daily work schedule to collaborate. However, people need the intelligence to use the technology so that they can collaborate - Web 2.0 Literacy!<br /><br />What changes in training or hiring of personnel would enhance innovation?<br /><br />Web 2.0 Literacy training and an accountability/editorial process - www.opensourcethinking.org (Coming Soon).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It's all about educating people how to use technology and how to use it effectively!</div><br />	cjennings	7	10	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2962-4049

2966-4049	Improve interagency emergency planning	2009-05-23 00:00:00	Commonly, at federal emergency exercises, one finds that some agency representatives have mistaken perceptions of the emergency roles and procedures of other agencies. The national response plan is helpful in that regard, but provides inadequate detail. Potential disconnects should be addressed in the planning process, not during an emergency. There are two ways to address the problem:<br /><br />1) Allow each federal agency to review the emergency plans of other federal agencies. Then, in the plan revision process, agencies can see how their plans need revision in order to mesh with those of the other agencies. <br /><br />2) The federal agencies could establish a plan review team, with representatives from each agency, to review the plans for disconnects and set up meetings with other agency representatives to resolve the disconnects.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	lewisplan	11	12	1	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2966-4049

2971-4049	Use Randomly Selected Citizen Deliberative Councils to tap the collective wisdom of We the People 	2009-05-23 00:00:00	Ad hoc, randomly selected, well-informed citizen deliberative councils like Citizens Juries, Citizen Assemblies, and Consensus Conferences have been used hundreds of times around the world to provide policy guidance to public officials and the citizenry. The U.S. lags far behind in their use.<br /><br />These similar approaches all enable a microcosm of a country or community to generate informed public judgment about specific issues. <br /><br />They are not legislatures. They are temporary councils, more like juries, but they deliberate on public issues rather than private guilt, and they are far more actively engaged in becoming informed than any jury can be. They get professional help in hearing each other and creatively deliberating. <br /><br />As with juries, random selection (a) creates greater diversity than one finds in a legislature, (b) makes it much harder for corrupting influences to skew the results, and (c) levels the conversation with an assumption that all participants are peers. Also like a jury, a citizen deliberative council disbands as soon as it completes its work.<br /><br />These councils can be used for any number of purposes -- to recommend solutions, to evaluate proposed legislation or ballot initiatives, to evaluate the performance of public officials or interview politicians seeking election, and more. They are useful wherever a dependable, informed, reflective non-partisan (or "transpartisan") "voice of the whole" is desired. Their recommendations can be advisory, or a mandate, or they can be put to a vote by the electorate.<br /><br />A related process, a citizens' Wisdom Council, could serve as an annual "state of the union address" by a group of randomly selected citizens officially convened for the purpose. They would not be assigned an issue to deliberate, but would have a creative conversation for several days and come to consensus conclusions they would then share with the country. Whatever they came up with would certainly stimulate much discussion!<br /><br />The point I would like to raise in this proposal for discussion is that randomly selected councils of citizens can, under the right conditions, generate far wiser recommendations than vast dialogue and deliberation programs involving thousands or millions of people. Random selection -- sortition -- was the foundation of Athenian Democracy. Well designed microcosms can be more demographically representative of a whole community than a self-selected group or an elected legislature -- although all three forms have their democratic roles. Perhaps most important in these times of tight budgets, government resources -- organizational, informational and facilitation -- can be more focused, resulting in higher quality outcomes at less cost.<br /><br />This approach can also complement broader community or national dialogues. The special outcomes of citizen deliberative councils can be fed into the more broadly participative dialogues and deliberations proposed here by others. The outcomes of citizen deliberative councils add a totally new voice -- the voice of the whole -- to the usually partisan public discourse we think of as democracy.<br /><br />For more information on this approach and links to the various related practices, see http://www.co-intelligence.org/CDCUsesAndPotency.html.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This approach provides an inexpensive, effective way to bring the voice of the whole community or country into partisan public discourse or to provide useful, thoughtful advice to policy-makers.</div><br />	cii	137	160	23	10	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2971-4049

2980-4049	Vital Discussion of New Governance Paradigm	2009-05-23 00:00:00	The Open Government Dialogue here suggests two different takes on how technology changes public governance. The first is that Internet technology makes government more efficient; the second is that technology completely transforms the democratic governing process. <br /><br />This contrasts 20th century "command and control" with 21st century "open source" government and the best analogy would be Encyclopedia Britannica vs. Wikipedia. EB is (was?) a typical command and control, hierarchical, corporate institution. It provided the capital and coordination required to produce and distribute that physical product of encyclopedic volumes. EB has a CEO, a Board of Directors and an organizational structure of departments under a strict hierarchy. (Much like our federal government and bureaucracy.) It's a 20th century top-down corporate governance model that reflected the technology of the time.<br /><br />Wikipedia employs a radically different bottom-up model. It's content is controlled by its users, there is no CEO or management hierarchy. It is not financed by shareholders or a complex ownership structure, but by grants and charitable contributions. Yet, it supplies the desired good so efficiently that it has obliterated the old model of command and control. <br /><br />This suggests that eGov will take us far beyond making government more efficient to shifting power away from command and control to users (voters). This should make political leadership, parties, interest groups, etc. less relevant and more accountable to the public will. It also suggests that the current shift to bigger, more efficient centralized government control is a futile attempt to revitalize an obsolete model by tweaking it around the edges. But Wikipedia didn't make Britannica more efficient - it annihilated it. The ultimate irony may be that the failure of 20th century command and control governance has yielded an odd nostalgia for more of the same. Hopefully the OGD can help us change direction - the debate over universal health care will be the prime test case.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>We must go beyond the notion of more efficient command and control government to transforming and empowering self-government.</div><br />	michael	7	12	5	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2980-4049

2991-4049	NEPA.GOV: Modernize the National Environmental Policy Process to Mandate Online Participation	2009-05-23 00:00:00	The 1969 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) remains, in many federal agencies, an antiquated paper-based process that does not use the power of Internet-based technologies to encourage and facilitate expanded public participation. <br /><br />It is time to modernize this legal process to provide citizens the opportunity to fully participate in NEPA processes online. In particular, modern web-based technologies should be provided to make formal comments and to engage in direct and open dialog with the government officials who make environmental decisions. <br /><br />Further, all NEPA actions government-wide should be available on a central site (e.g. NEPA.gov). At this site, visitors will find a standard user interface, navigable lists of all pending decision processes, and an archive of all past decisions, all of which will be fully searchable.<br /><br />For example, citizens who want to fully participate in NEPA should be able to view all projects pending across the nation at NEPA.gov. They should then have access to simple user interface that allows them to post formal comments which become viewable and searchable by any other interested citizen (similar to this Open Government Dialogue site). These comments should also be made available in a common database format for download so any person or group could use their own software and methodologies to independently analyze comments in direct competition with the comment analysis of government officials.<br /><br />Of course, all other data, reports, and documents related to a NEPA project should also be placed online within legally mandated time lines that allow sufficient citizen examination and review well before any decision is made.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>As the ecosystems of public lands become increasingly stressed by population and economic pressures, and as those lands become increasingly valuable for their ecological services (clean water, clean air, local climate), especially in light of global climate change and accelerating extinction of species, citizens must be given abundant opportunities to participate in actions/decisions that will directly impact their environment. Currently, efforts by federal agencies to conduct NEPA processes online are disparate, inconsistent, or even absent. With a central website and a standard user interface, participation in environmental actions will flourish, and ultimately that will mean we (and our environment) will benefit from better decisions. </div><br />	johnable23	19	25	6	6	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2991-4049

2994-4049	Foreign Aid Database	2009-05-23 00:00:00	<br /><br />This is a suggestion from a private citizen about improving foreign aid operations. In general I am suggesting increased transparency and coordination. Specifically this boils down to an itemized list of all the aid projects currently being carried out in the world. The list should include the location where the project is being carried out, what aid agency or charity organization is behind it, and the nature of the project (whether it is for food security, water, healthcare, etc.). USAID, of course, already has this information for its own projects. Yet it should also have a list of what other aid agencies and charity organizations are doing. Such a listing is necessary for USAID to choose its own development projects appropriately. It needs to know what development projects are being carried out by other donors, what projects are being planned by other donors, and what areas are being neglected. In a recent research report done for the World Bank, it is stated that improved allocation of aid could double aid's effectiveness. ( http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&theSitePK;=469382&piPK;=64165421&menuPK;=64166093&entityID;=00000948620040521170827 ) In these times of economic downturn such a savings should not be wasted.<br /><br />One doesn't really need to argue that such a database would be a valuable asset. I doubt that anyone would seriously question the cost effectiveness of accurate foreign aid data. Yet, such a comprehensive listing of aid projects is still missing. If it does exist, it is being kept from the public's view. Curiously, this seems to be standard performance for all of the aid agencies in the world. For example, not one of the other 30 OECD donor countries, nor the World Bank, nor the United Nations have collected this data either. This data is not particularly hard to get. Each donor nation individually keeps records of their own activities, as do the many private charity organizations. Much of the information is probably publicly available. It remains, however, for someone to assemble all the data in one place so that everyone can benefit. It is inconceivable to me that foreign aid agencies around the world currently go about their businesses independently, without checking to see what the others are doing. It must then be impossible for a nation to plan ahead effectively, since it doesn't have access to the other nations' plans. Also, the many private charities need to have access to this information. In order to plan their own activities effectively, they too need to know what the other donors are doing. However, since private charities are unable to compile this data, they are dependent on the government providing it for them. <br /><br />Such a comprehensive listing of aid projects should be available on a country by country basis, as well as regionally, and it must definitely be accessible by the public. This would provide invaluable assistance to the many charities that work abroad and it would educate the people at the same time. People would be able to see at a glance how much is being done in any given country, what types of projects are being carried out, which organizations are directing them, and (importantly) to whom they might send a donation if they wanted. It would also be very useful for foreign policymakers to be able to easily view the foreign aid situation in any region of the world. Policy analysts would be able to to critique operations for waste and corruption. And, of course, it would assist foreign aid agencies around the world in coordinating their actions and accomplishing their objectives.<br /><br />One plausible explanation for why such a useful database does not exist, and one which I hope is not true, is that corrupt special interests profit from a lack of transparency. For instance, I have heard it said that half of America's foreign assistance budget is spent on its own "advisors" and not necessarily on development. It is also commonly stated that recipient nations can be quite corrupt themselves. Perhaps it is the lobbying activities of these beneficiaries of the current system which prevent meaningful reforms in accountability and transparency. All the more reason, then, to firmly establish a coordination database. This will shine as much light as possible on the misuse of foreign aid dollars. As standard procedure every government agency should strive to be as transparent and accountable as possible, and there is no reason why foreign aid needs to be an exception.<br /><br />An additional and perhaps overlooked consequence of improved transparency and coordination is the potential impact this would have on private donations. Although the role of private donors in fighting global poverty is often downplayed, yet in America alone private citizens donate billions of dollars each year. According to Charity Navigator, of the $306 billion Americans donated in 2007, $13.2 billion went to international charities. ( http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid;=42 ) This is a sizable sum which significantly augments the foreign aid budget. If it were possible for Americans to see exactly what is and is not being done to end global poverty, that sum might increase significantly. Currently there are a great many misconceptions about poverty in this country, and a coordination database would change that.<br /><br />The importance of a well-informed public on this issue cannot be overstated. As of now, even the barest fundamentals are very often misunderstood. One common misconception is that eradicating poverty is very expensive. For example, few people probably can state how much it would cost to feed all the hungry people of the world. The answer exists, however: according to the World Food Program there are 923 million people without enough to eat. ( http://www.wfp.org/aboutwfp/facts/index.asp?section=1&sub;_section=5 ) At 35 cents per person per day all year round, that comes to just under $118 billion per year. (That figure comes from WFP's 2005 budget of $2.9 billion for 4.2 million metric tonnes and an average ration of ½ kilogram per day--see previous link.) Given a total annual world GDP of over $65 trillion, that's less than ¼ of one percent of the world's income. ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html ). These are exactly the types of statistics that an aid database would bring to light. Most Americans, though, have never seen these figures. They don't know how relatively cheap ending hunger actually is.<br /><br />To pursue this point even further, let's look at the statistics for the other components of poverty. For example: <br /><br />Water: The World Health Organization has estimated $136.5 billion (probably more) per year for 10 years to provide in-house piped water supply and in-house sewerage connection for the entire world. ( http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/wsh0404summary/en/index.html )<br />Healthcare: The World Health Organization Commission on Macroeconomics and Health has estimated that in order to deliver a set of basic healthcare interventions to the entire world it would cost $27 billion per year starting in 2007, increasing up to $38 billion per year in 2015. ( http://www.who.int/macrohealth/infocentre/advocacy/en/investinginhealth02052003.pdf<br />Education: The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization tells us $11 billion a year in foreign aid is required to provide primary education to every child in the world. ( http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001477/147785E.pdf )<br />Electricity: The United Nations Development Program and the World Energy Assessment tell us that if we want to provide electricity to the whole planet, $165 billion a year is required. ( http://www.undp.org/energy/weaover2004.htm and also: http://www.energyandenvironment.undp.org/undp/indexAction.cfm?module=Library&action;=GetFile&DocumentAttachmentID;=2210 )<br /><br />An aid database such as I am describing would allow all these sums to be documented and statistically broken down for public viewing. All together these figures add up to $468.5 billion per year for the first ten years and drop dramatically thereafter. That's less that one percent of the world's income: hardly an insurmountable obstacle. If one wanted to, one could even err heavily on the conservative side and still be well within range. One could allocate $200 billion each for food, water and electricity, $100 billion for education/healthcare and even throw in another $100 billion for roads and home building materials. All this would still add up to only $800 billion per year--about 1.25 percent of the world's GDP. Ten years later a lot of the infrastructure would be finished and the clean water supply would yield more food and less disease. At that point the totals would come down considerably. According to the data given here, to fully eradicate poverty in 10 to 20 years the world only needs donate about one percent of its annual income. I doubt that even a majority of Congress is aware of this statistic, let alone a majority of the American public.<br /><br />The point to all these numbers is that ending global poverty is amazingly affordable. Yet, no one seems to realize this simple fact. It is a goal entirely within our reach and in fact could have been accomplished decades ago. The world needs to know this. If Americans in general possessed an adequate understanding of the relative costs of eradicating global poverty, things would change dramatically. A detailed database showing what is and is not being done to help the world's poor would go a long way toward that goal. As of now though, the vast majority of Americans have never seen these types of statistics. Much more needs to be done to educate the electorate on this most important issue. Americans have a right to know where the world stands in the fight against global poverty.<br /><br />The fact that Americans have a lot of misconceptions about foreign aid has been documented. The Program on International Policy Attitudes (PIPA) conducts in depth studies of public opinion. ( http://www.pipa.org/ ) One of its findings has continued to be that Americans vastly overestimate the amount of money the federal government spends on foreign aid. In fact, the median amount the public estimates is 20% of the federal budget. This is more than twenty times the actual amount. ( http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/btdevelopmentaidra/135.php?lb=btda&pnt;=135&nid;=&id;= ) Not surprisingly, many people feel that this should be "reduced" to just ten percent. The actual figures, however, are quite different. According to the OECD, in 2007 donor nations gave a combined total of just 0.28 percent of their gross national income. ( http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/27/55/40381862.pdf ) America, notably dead last out of 22 nations tallied, gave 0.16 percent of its per capita income. Meanwhile, the internationally agreed upon target all along has been 0.7 percent. ( http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/press/07.htm ) The goal of 0.7 percent was first pledged over 35 years ago, in 1970, at the United Nations. It has been affirmed many times over the years, and again as part of the Millennium Development Goals, but still has never been attained. These figures are in stark contrast with public opinion.<br /><br />Given the amount that most Americans think is being contributed, and the amount that they think ought to be contributed, it's quite likely that many Americans would be very angry if they knew what really is being contributed. Certainly no one opposes a well-informed public. But turning that ideal into a reality requires some action. The government must do its part by compiling and publishing relevant aid data. There is no excuse for not having accurate information. A detailed foreign aid database is truly a necessity for effective foreign aid policy. The fact that private charity organizations have to do without this vital tool is equally indefensible. Again, their activities effectively augment the foreign aid budget by billions of dollars every year. To force them to do their work "in the dark", so to speak, is pure waste.<br /><br />For all these reasons, I am asking that you, the reader of this letter, personally do your part in making this project a reality. Please advocate to the appropriate policymaker the sensibility of a detailed foreign aid database. It could double the effectiveness of foreign aid. It could lead to billions of dollars more in private donations. It could drastically reduce corruption and the misuse of foreign aid dollars. It would certainly help educate the public on this very important social issue. And, it would cost very little to implement. Most of the data already exists, it is simply a matter of putting it all one place. One might even look at it as nothing more than effective record keeping. Finally, though I'm sure it sounds cliché-ish, if nothing else do it for the children. Your efforts might save a life somewhere.

2996-4049	Use Government Agencies Need to be Connected With Experienced Private Third Party Facilitators for Deliberative Public Partcipat	2009-05-23 00:00:00	Hmm, I can't edit the title of my posting with this system! If I could I'd like to call this idea "Yelp for Public Engagement."<br /><br />When I think of public-private partnerships and public engagement, I think about the fairly common practice of government agencies hiring a consultant or a private or nonprofit organization to facilitate, and sometimes to conduct outreach and/or assessment of, a public engagement process. While some cities are beginning to embed deliberative public engagement into their everyday practices to the extent that it makes sense to hire and train their staff to carry out these duties, many other cities and counties are in early stages of experimenting with this form of participatory democracy. Hiring experienced consultants, firms, or nonprofits to help out is a great way to bring in experience necessary for successful public engagement projects. It can also help to set residents minds at ease to talk with a professional and independent consultant, rather than a government agency staff person who people might tend to be more suspicious of.<br /><br />There should be a mechanism for federal, state, and local agencies to get unbiased information about all of the public engagement providers and facilitators who are out there. Maybe something like Yelp (the website) for public engagement, where users can rate and comment on providers? The field has a wide range of practitioner to offer and its important for there to be a good fit between the community and the practitioner. I suggest it would serve government agencies well to have some tools for being able to shop around to find the best fit in terms of public engagement consulting.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	gregkeidan	-4	5	9	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2996-4049

2998-4049	Open Source Agency per 9-11 Commission	2009-05-23 00:00:00	Create the Open Source Agency (OSA) recommended by the 9-11 Commission on page 413, consistent with the Aspin-Brown ("should be a top priority") and Moynihan Commissions and others, to accomplish three things:<br /><br />1. Serve as the public intelligence agency, creating Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) that can be used to support the 99% of the US Government, state and local governments, and citizen groups that do not receive secret intelligence support today (i.e. everyone except the President, who only gets 4% of what he needs at a cost to the taxpayer of $65-75 billion a year).<br /><br />2. Serve as the national proponent, skunk works, and support agency for moving the entire nation to Free/Open Source Software (F/OSS) to end the corruption, fraud, waste, and abuse as well as the massive loss of productivity associated with proprietary software that is also unsafe.<br /><br />3. Serve as the national proponent, skunk works, and support agency for Open Spectrum as recommended by David Weinberger, Jock Gill, and others, to end the monopolization of frequencies by parties that are inherently inefficient and often corrupt.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the OSA should NOT be part of the secret intelligence community, which calls Open Source Intelligence "Open Sores", but rather be fully-funded by the Department of Defense via non-reimbursable funding to the Department of State, where the OSA would be the sister agency to the Broadcasting Board of Governors (one brings global knowledge in, the other broadcasts US knowledge out).<br /><br />750 international professionals have spoken to and worked with 7,500 international mid-career professionals across eight tribes of intelligence (government, military, law enforcement, academia, business, media, non-governmental, and civil society including labor unions and religions) for 20 years in pursuit of this objective.<br /><br />The Open Source Agency as formulated by all of these professionals, and as discussed with citizen groups in recent years, would fund:<br /><br />1. National Strategy Center with full public transparency and participation, such that the Executive and Congress and Governors would be required to create coherent strategies that address the ten high-level threats to humanity (Poverty, Infectious Disease, Environmental Degradation, Inter-State Conflict, Civil War, Genocide, Other Atrocities, Proliferation, Terrorism, and Transnational Crime) by coherently harmonizing the twelve core policy domains (Agriculture, Diplomacy, Economy, Education, Energy, Family, Health, Immigration, Justice, Security, Society, Water) and budgets, all transparently, all with public "common sense" participation, all with a total elimination of the earmarks that have led to a Congress Of, By, and For Wall Street.<br /><br />2. Multinational Decision Support Center, building on the pioneering done by the US Central Command with the Coalition Coordination Center, but bringing together mid-career intelligence analysts from 90 nations instead of logisticians, working only with public information, and providing decision support to all organizations world-wide that are working toward peace and prosperity in the public lnterest.<br /><br />3. Assistant Secretary General for Decision Support in the United Nations, a ten person office funded by the OSA with a US Ambassador as Deputy and double-hatted as the Director of the Office of Information Sharing Treaties and Agreements. This is how we vacuum clean the raw data in the UN System, which is nearly incoherent, and give back to the UN sense-making while leveraging the information across the ten threats and twelve policies to harmonized the budgets of 90+ nations against common objectives.<br /><br />4. Global Range of Needs and Gifts Table, an online capability that can be connected to via RapidSMS such as being pioneered by UNICEF so brilliantly, such that anyone can enter a "peace target" and anyone (or any group of individuals, or organizations) can commit to meeting the need. Like needs can be clustered, blocks of giving can be distributed, all transparent.<br /><br />For more information about all of this, visit www.oss.net and www.earth-intelligence.net. Two free books online relevant to evaluating this idea are COLLECIVE INTELLIGENCE: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace, at www.oss.net/CIB; and ELECTION 2008: Lipstick on the Pig, at www.oss.net/PIG, with the chapters on Substance of Governance and the Annotated Bibliography particularly recommended.<br /><br />We pray that this Administration will understand that "bipartisan" is what happens when the two parties shutting out all other parties agree to get together and stick it to the US taxpayer. An Open Source Agency will empower all of the people all of the time, and leave no corrupt deed hidden--"put enough eyeballs on it, you get honest government Of By and For We the People."<br /><br />-----------ADDED COMMENT FOR PERSPECTIVE--------------<br /><br />A colleague whose knowledge I deeply respect has pointed out that as written my proposal for an Open Source Agency alienates every single major constituency now in power. As much as I regret that, that is the point.<br /><br />HOWEVER, while demanding that we all take back the power and become the informed citizens in charge of the Republic and the government that is supposed to serve We the People, not treat us with contempt as is now the case, I do wish to point out a couple of things:<br /><br />1) Intellectual property, spectrum rights, and various other trappings of capitalism as we now have it need to be reviewed, respected, and renegotiated. To take one example, the purchase of Congress by Disney and other publishers to extend copyright far beyond the vision of the founders is corrupt, plain and simple. Similarly, patents filed to keep new technologies off the market (including green energy, permanent paints, long-lasting anything) need to be restrained in the public interest--use it or lose it.<br /><br />2) Predatory immoral capitalism has destroyed the Republic and most of the world. I point to John Bogle's book on The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism, William Grieder's book on The Soul of Capitalism, and Howard Bloom's forthcoming book on The Genius of the Beast: A Radical Re-Vision of Capitalsim that I totally endorse. MORAL capitalism seeks to do well by doing good and that kind of capitalism is what I support.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I apologize to all those that will be offended by my scorched earth depiction of what an Open Source Agency needs to do in the public interest (the book length version at Amazon and free at www.oss.net/BOOKS is THE SMART NATION ACT: Public Intelligence in the Public Interest). There is absolutely no question in my mind but that an Open Source Agency will allow We the People to manage every aspect of our Nation's transformation with accountability, integrity, and transparency. The Golden Rule will apply. It's time we take our country back.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea supports every single one of the objectives from Transparency to Participation and Collaboration and Capacity Building to restoring the Constitution and the Rule of Law.</div><br />	Robert David STEELE Vivas	23	29	6	5	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2998-4049	
2999-4049	Mandatory Annual Government Agency Report Card	2009-05-23 00:00:00	Increasing Transparency:<br />Via an Annual Government Report Card Assessing Agency Performance<br />by bruce@industriallogic.com<br /><br />An effective way of redressing the lack of accountability of government officials and increasing the voice of the people in a representative, meaningful, non-partisan and fair way would be have each government agency prepare and administer a survey of the users of its services to determine the degree of satisfaction with the way the services have been provided.<br /><br />On an annual basis, the surveys would be:<br />• Developed and refined by each government entity and program<br />• Vetted for its evaluative efficacy by the auditing agency (e.g. Office of Management and Budget)<br />• Administered by rotating independent research firms to assure statistical randomness and fairness to the individuals, businesses, organizations, and government agencies using the government agency's services<br />• Reported in the public media as an annual Government Report Card<br /><br />The benefits that would accrue include:<br />• Agencies would get feedback about the perceived value of their programs to their constituencies so that they could adjust their approaches or abandon futile enterprises, thereby producing increased productivity for taxpayer dollars<br />• The legislature would be aided in its oversight of the executive branch so that budgets could be better matched to results<br />• The responding public would feel empowered, thereby helping to dispel some of the currently experienced sense of helplessness about affecting government decision making<br />• The nation would be improved by the expansion of government accountability for performance and the reduction of the importance of politics in agency operations<br />• The international reputation of the United States as a genuine example of democracy would be enhanced<br /><br />In contrast to polls that tell of the overall level of satisfaction with the legislature, these surveys would be specific regarding the value of each program to the recipients of the services involved.<br /><br />The cost of such a systemic evaluative process would be modest to establish, and minimal to operate subsequently, especially in relation to the benefits that would obtain in making the quality of government operations visible to the citizenry and the world.<br /><br />Because this idea has received nearly universal approval from citizens to whom it has been described, and pretty much ignored by the government officials and media organizations to which it has been submitted, it seems that the only practical way of implementing it is by Executive order.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Provides agency feedback, facilitates legislative oversight, empowers the responding public, makes agencies accountable, and promotes the US as a democracy, while costing very little to implement.</div><br />	bruce	7	14	7	5	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2999-4049

3001-4049	Structured approach to matching questions and responders	2009-05-23 00:00:00	While "government for the people by the people" gives all citizens the same right to participate, and this right should be preserved, contributing to the process of solving problems of our society shall often require specific knowledge. The proposal here is to structure the internet-based response to ensure that each particular topic does receive response from the citizens most qualified/knowledgeable to give such response. This is not to exclude anyone who wishes to participate but to ensure that well-considered and balanced opinions and the ultimate solution are reached. For example, there will clearly be cases on which all citizens should express opinions, for example "Should this country go to war?" (for the sake of a better example). However, there will be also topics that have a deep technical content (financial, legal, scientific) for which specific knowledge is needed.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It is important that we solve issues of the society not simply by a popular vote, by a "popularity contest" but solve such with the full knowledge and understanding of the facts and in full anticipation of consequences of any particular solution. As this initiative has stated, all the knowledge this society needs to govern itself is contained within its citizens. It is thus important that system is put in place that fully harnesses and utilizes such knowledge.</div><br />	klpetrak	-7	3	10	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3001-4049

3004-4049	Who at the end is responsible for making and implementing decisions?	2009-05-23 00:00:00	"Open government", the term eGov seems to be popular now, is a fine idea as far as ADVISORY POWER of the citizens is concerned and harnessed. Involvement of all of us should soon lead to a very much reduced need for extensive administration. However, we still need to preserve a structure in which someone is responsible for the ultimate decisions to be taken.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Because there cannot be freedom without responsibility!</div><br />	klpetrak	-3	4	7	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3004-4049	
3005-4049	All contact with legislative representatives about legislative matters should be required to be witnessed and recorded	2009-05-24 00:00:00	I can think of only a few exceptions that would not require any and all contact with legislative representatives concerning official legislative matters from being recorded, witnessed by required attendants, and open to the public at prescribed times and locations. The recorded information should then become immediately available on the Internet for all to be able to witness. National Security issues and other special exception sensitive matters can be arranged to be handled in a special manner, but it should not prevent virtually any and all other submissions and replies between legislators and those who contact (lobby) them from being open completely, and with severe and rapidly enforced prosecutions for violations or attempted violations. That could and should include immediate loss of office for the legislator and other forms of severe sanctions for any individual's attempt to violate or commission of violation of this legal requirement. A rapid review by the court system of the validity of charges of violations (that would be outlined in detail in the legislation that creates this mandate) would conclude the enforcement.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This is nothing more than the idea of open government being made real before the fact, not after. Albeit a recommendation for improving only the legislative process which has become so corrupted by money, so much of open government efforts are directed to accessing information after it is has been acted upon by the Congress or other government entities. This recommended set of stipulations and restrictions would be a major improvement by virtue of the fact that it allows participatory democracy to have a more potent influence on all legislative matters before they are enacted. It could, if properly enforced and utilized by the citizenry, be a monumental improvement in obstructing unethical and corrupt deal making for the benefit and/or profit of the few with exceptional monetary or other forms of influence on legislators.</div><br />	hhannam	-7	13	20	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3005-4049

It is very easy for powerful interests to mobilize their members/friends to participate, skewing things in directions that are favorable to their views. We already have examples of that on this site. Imagine the AARP mobilizing its membership to re-write the laws for Social Security and Medicare. In the real world, motivated and coached guidance from AARP to its membership would end up drowning out other voices.

3010-4049	implement 360 degree performance appraisals in federal government	2009-05-24 00:00:00	The federal government needs to move to 360 degree performance appraisals, in which more than just a person's boss opines about an employee's performance in his or her job. It is too easy for a boss to be subjective, without a check of getting the views of the employee's peers and subordinates. It's very easy, for example, for a manager or executive to look good to his or her boss, but be just an awful manager of his or her subordinates. Many higher-level executives never learn how badly their subordinate managers and executives are doing, because they do not care to gather input from the subordinates of their subordinates, or they do not have a systematic way to do so. 360 reviews require work and forethought to operate correctly, but if you have worked for awful bosses before, the opportunity cost of not evaluating them is quite high. Technology might be able to play a facilitating role in this, but OPM and the protectors of the merit system would need to devote a lot of thought and care to how to do this.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	ctb14	26	30	4	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3010-4049	
3011-4049	STUDENT LOANS	2009-05-24 00:00:00	For students unable to began re-paying their student loans at the designated time, develop a program (possibly on the model of Job Corps, Peace Corps, etc.) that provides a needed and relevant service to designated federal agencies, state agencies and/or community organizations where students would enter a "contract" to provide "creditable" service to the program that would be credited toward reduction of the principal balance of the student loan. Standards should be established that the student's work must meet and maintain to achieve the creditable service (if an employee's work must reach a minimum standard when evaulated to receive pay, bonus, retention then so should the student's work). If possible and funds are available, maybe students could receive pay and credit in the reduction of the student loan balance in the manner of an intern program.<br /><br />The program should have a certain number of slots available for students and once a student obtains a job and is able to make his/her monthly student loan payment for at least a quarter, that student would leave the program and that slot would be given to another student that does not have the financial ability to make his/her monthly student loan payment. <br /><br />To be eligible for this program, the student must provide documentation of his/her efforts to obtain a paying job during the time frame between leaving college and the designated time to begin repayment of the student loan.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This provides an opportunity for students to fulfill the obligation to repay a student loan and provide a relevant needed service to the government or state that made the loan possible while seeking and obtaining a paying job. By establishing a standard for the student's work to meet to receive credit to the student loan, it would avoid the possibility of students receiving loan reductions by just signing and "showing up" without working to better the government, agency or organization.</div><br />	truebluetexanq	12	19	7	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3011-4049

They refuse to embrace Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), calling it "Open Sores," and are totally irresponsible in failing to provide decision support to every Cabinet Department, every Agency, and every member of Congress.<br /><br />Below are some fundamental things that could be done to dramatically enhance "decision support" across the entire government and across the Nation:<br /><br />Intelligence Reform--Global Understanding, State & Local Security<br /><br />"Nothing in the existing or planned Federal budget makes America any safer!<br /><br />When both the incumbent President and the incumbent Director of Central Intelligence persist in telling America that 9-11 was not an intelligence failure, they demonstrate nothing more than their ignorance and their lack of respect for the common sense of the people. Below are specific intelligence reforms I want to see championed by a candidate and team of substance, because how America understands the rest of the world and its dangers really matters to the future security and prosperity for many generations:<br /><br />1) National Security Act of 2005. Will provide for the revitalization of national intelligence and counterintelligence in the context of a "Smart Nation" in which every element of government--non-secret as well as secret--is wired together so we can collect the dots, connect the dots, and never again drop the ball. Within this Act should be the following specific reforms:<br /><br />a) Restructuring of the Presidential staff to create four Director-Generals for Policy, Strategy, Intelligence, and Research. America has no serious strategy for its future, intelligence is not impacting on policy or strategy, and government research (as well as taxation policies) are retarding rather than advancing the private sector's ability to be innovative.<br /><br />b) Creation of a consolidated National Foreign Intelligence Program that gives the Director-General for Intelligence control over the three technical intelligence agencies now within the defense department, while earmarking 50% of the program in peace, 85% in war, for defense needs.<br /><br />c) Elevation of the National Intelligence Council to the Office of the President, where it can do a better job of harnessing the distributed intelligence of the entire Nation, while also working more closely with the Cabinet departments.<br /><br />d) Establishment of the Global Knowledge Foundation, a $1.5 billion a year ".org" dedicated to helping all elements of the government as well as the private sector gain better access to open sources of information in all languages of the world--80% of what we need for 5% of the cost of secrets. Includes creation of a "virtual national intelligence community" of leading experts on everything who do not want top secret clearances, and Digital Marshall Plan for Third World. <br /><br />e) National Analysis Agency. Redirection (with downsizing) of the Central Intelligence Agency toward strategic analysis, while restoring the responsibilities and capabilities of the individual Cabinet departments to do coherent strategic and tactical intelligence analysis.<br /><br />f) National Processing Agency. Redirection (with downsizing) of the National Security Agency to leverage its extraordinary capabilities in processing, such that it can "make sense" of all non-secret as well as secret information needed to keep America safe while improving government decision-support over-all (e.g. visualization of complex non-secret databases).<br /><br />g) National Collection Agency. Redirection (with downsizing) of the National Reconnaissance Office to become an "all-source" technical collection agency able to both create multiple forms of technical collection platforms, while avoiding competition among different "pipes."<br /><br />h) Clandestine Service Agency. Coincident with a gradual decommissioning of the existing clandestine service that is not clandestine at all, create a completely new but very narrowly-focused capability for in extremis requirements that is characterized by very deep non-official cover, multi-national career personnel, and the ability to manage both unilateral and multi-lateral clandestine penetrations of both state and non-state actors threatening the Nation.<br /><br />i) Homeland Security Intelligence Program. Redirect 20% of the existing $38 billion per year from wasteful earmarked expenditures on emergency responder and "hard-wired" counter-terrorism capabilities that are not agile, toward the establishment of state & local Community Intelligence Centers and networks--we must teach our localities to fish for sharks, don't try to fish for them.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Stupid is as stupid does. We have a stupid intelligence community, like morons, because they are engorssed in their Top Secret Codeword work (processing less than 5% of what they collect via very expensive secret technical means, with Human Intelligence (HUMINT) long gone, now reliant on foreign liaison "hand-outs"). I have written a number of books on this subject, and both President Obama and Leon Panetta (and Colin Powell as well as Hillary Clinton) have sets of those books in their possession. They refuse to be pro-active in this area for two reasons: 1) the contractors and Congress do not want to give up their secret fraud, waste, and abuse; and 2) the public does not realize that CIA lies to Congress with frequency, and that neither the Bush Administration nor the Obama Administration are actually being responsible about creating a national intelligence (decision support) capability that is relevant to addressing the ten high-level threats to humanity, across the twelve core policies.<br /><br />Read more at www.oss.net and www.earth-intelligence.net. I am 56, with 20-30 years to go, God willing. I am now, in my own mind, intelligence officer to the public, and the public needs to demand intelligence reform along with electoral reform, national security reform, and governance reform.<br /><br />See Open Source Agency for an implementing idea that will immediately allow the President to cut the secret budget in half while redirecting $150 billion from the Pentagon budget to creating prosperity at home and waging peace abroad. Had he had honest informed intelligence managers, they would have protected him from the idiocy of Treasury, the Fed, and Larry "Women Cannot Think" Summers.</div><br />	Robert David STEELE Vivas	3	9	6	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3028-4049	
3029-4049	Government data enhancements (data.gov)	2009-05-24 00:00:00	Data.gov should have a crawling program to identify data agencies make available (usually as CSVs) & use a standard page listing the field names. Commonly accessed data should have more in depth description of fields provided by the corresponding agency.<br /><br />Widgets for blogs & other personal pages should be made to allow easy utilization of the data for casual or non-technical individuals. Simple functions could include line graphs, pie charts and YoY chart comparisons. More complex tools could join data from multiple sources such as budget numbers correlated with office incumbent time periods.<br /><br />The Bureau of Economic Analysis has a decent example in their "locking stubs" graphing feature. Choose a table to see what I'm talking about.<br />http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/<br /><br />Google has an API with the kind of visualization features I'm referring to. Providing an online form to generate graphing code for a page/blog would be a big step.<br />http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The Internet is an increasingly important tool for public discourse.

3030-4049	National Security Reform	2009-05-24 00:00:00	28 May 09. Responding to comment: Re-Invention would be better than Reform but I cannot change that now. National Security is spending $1 trillion a year against ONE of the ten high-level threats to humanity (Inter-State War) and is completely inept (terrorism, crime, civil war) or unintentested in the others (poverty, infectious disease, environmental degradation, genocide, other atrocities (includes human trafficking), proliferation. The whole point of this idea is to STOP spending $1 trillion on a largely worthless and corrupt military-industrial complex, REDEFINE national security to mean Creating a Prosperous World at Peace and a vibrant informed democracy at home. Free books at www.oss.net/CIB and www.oss.net/PIG. <br /><br />President and General Ike Eisenhower warned us. Today we have a military-industrial complex with 750 bases overseas, two elective wars, and a firm plan for a 50-year war that will "recycle" all military equipment (code for destroy in use and mandate replacement at higher cost). Out of the ten high-level threats to humanity identified by LtGen Brent Scowcroft, USAF (Ret) and other members of the UN High Level Threat Panel, the Pentagon is "optimized" (that is a kinder term than merited) for just one of those threats: Inter-State War, threat number four. Below are some ideas:<br /><br />Global Issues & National Security Reform--Revitalizing Soft Power<br /><br />"The world is on fire, but we can put this fire out!<br /><br />America leans toward isolationist and what I call "false neutral" positions. In a world at war with itself there are no neutral positions--only victims, if not today, then tomorrow. We need a candidate and team that can help America to properly interpret 9-11 as the early warning of global chaos, and terrorism as the least of our problems. There are 23 conflicts between countries killing 1000 or more a year; 79 conflicts between states killing less than 1000 a year; and 175 violent internal political conflicts within states. The world is at war and no one at home realizes the threat this implies for America's future. At the same time there are 32 complex emergencies--failed states--today; there are 66 countries with millions of displaced persons and refugees; 33 countries suffering famine and starvation; 59 countries and rising with plagues and epidemics. There are 18 genocide campaigns going on, today; child soldiers are killing and being killed in 41 countries; corruption is common in 80 countries, and censorship in 62 countries. <br /><br />This is the real world and it is a world that the two mainstream parties and their corporate paymasters are ignoring because they travel first class and can make their money from the safety of their gated communities. America spends over $500B a year on a "heavy metal" military that is useless 90% of the time, at the same time that we underfund special operations and low intensity conflict forces, underfund diplomacy, overt intelligence, and economic assistance, underfund education at home and abroad, ignore public health, and ignore public safety around the world, allowing warlords and crime kingpins a free run. This has to stop but it will not stop unless America finds a leader of gravitas who is truly representative of both our values, and the power of our budget if spend wisely. This new national security strategy could be called "1+iii" and could, within the $500 billion a year now being spent (greater than what the next 20 nations, including Russia and China, spend together), redirect funds as follows:<br /><br />1) Big War. Fence at $250 billion a year, fully 50% of the national security budget. Designed to be able to take on the Russians and the Chinese simultaneously, inclusive of strategic nuclear forces, a 12 division-wing-carrier battle group team, and reserve-reinforcement bridges to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces. Protected from small war or other distractions, focuses on being ready for catastrophic confrontation at all times. <br /><br />2) Small War. Increase from $20 billion to $75 billion a year, 15% of the national security budget. Continues the elevation of the U.S. Special Operations Command as a global operational force, but introduces constabulary-gendarme forces that can impose order within failed states while providing police, medical, and other critical public services needed in the transition back to local control and security. Creates a new "ground truth" force that provides each regional theater with a battalion of foreign area officers skilled in foreign languages and cultural understanding. Creates a new national foreign area and foreign language reserve of both citizens and immigrants who provide peacetime translation services for intelligence, and wartime translation through 24/7 video cell-phone connections to units in the field.<br /><br />3) Peace Force. Increase from $20 billion to $100 billion a year, 20% of the national security budget. Dramatically restores the competency and global presence of the Department of State; reinstates the independence of the U.S. Information Agency, doubling the latter. Increases the Peace Corps and the Agency for International Development, with a special emphasis on water and food security as well as public health. Creates a new fund for economic assistance to individual entrepreneurs (micro-lending) and a new fund for environmental sustainability, as well as an international peace reserve (part of a national security education initiative) of language-qualified citizens ready to engage in short and mid-term sustainability and stability projects at entry-level, mid-career, and in retirement.<br /><br />4) Home Force. Increase from $38 billion (was $16 billion) to $75 billion a year, 15% of the national security budget. This investment recognizes that in the age of networked non-state actors--what Thomas Friedman from The New York Times calls "super-empowered angry men," it is not possible to federalize security at the state & local level. Apart from the investment in a Homeland Security Intelligence Program discussed above, major investments are needed in securing our borders and ports while providing massive restoration of public health capabilities (preventive medicine and early warning of emerging infectious threats) together with new initiatives in electronic and physical infrastructure hardening and protection. In combination with the intelligence reform initiatives, this investment will also "wire" state & local governments into the global grid and help create a "Smart Nation."<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Singapore got it when SARS came out, they realized they were responsible for defending the nation against ALL threats, not just those carrying guns and wearing uniforms. The Pentagon (and the White House) have ZERO in the way of Whole of Government strategic decision support. OMB gave up the M long ago, and frankly, no one really cares on our behalf as long as the money keeps flowing. Taxpayers have been "cut off" from how our money is spent, and I can absolutely assure you, 75% of what the Pentagon is spending today makes no sense at all.

3033-4049	Governance Reform	2009-05-24 00:00:00	Governance Reform--Coalition Approach, State Power, More Ethics<br /><br />"America can't be governed by one man and his buddies--it takes a coalition team.<br /><br />The world, and America, have gotten too complex to rely on a single President being elected, and then leaving the rest of the team up to his preferences. America needs to see a candidate for President that has both the courage and the "big tent" philosophy of non-partisan teamwork to pre-select and offer for inspection as part of their two-year campaign, a complete Cabinet. The process of devising a Coalition Cabinet should start now. A leader of a multi-party team, with a landslide popular and electoral vote behind them, should be able to carry out this comprehensive reform agenda that puts the power back in the people, and common sense back into a down-sized government. <br /><br />Emphasizing the need to use federal funding to empower state & local governments with respect to intelligence & counterintelligence could also set the stage for proposing new national initiatives for elementary and secondary education as well as public health across America. Thomas Jefferson said "A Nation's best defense is an educated citizenry." The people of this Nation are its seed corn, and we must tend these fields. Every American should receive the same high-quality education, regardless of the prevailing real estate values that now fund vastly disparate levels of education. At the same time, some form of universal health insurance is needed, not only to cover the uninsured, but also to liberate America's workers from their dependence on corporate health plans that constrain job mobility and innovation. Finally, we must dramatically re-invigorate our preventive medicine and public health programs to lower the costs to the taxpayer and our families of disease--including animal-borne epidemics--that could have been prevented in the first place.<br /><br />At the same time, we need a candidate who is very strong on ethics--America suffers when their leadership is perceived by both the people and the international public as being "in the pockets of" big oil or big pharmaceutical companies, or other special interests. The right candidate, with a proven mind of their own, can make the economic case for ethics. A Nobel Prize was awarded for a demonstration that trust lowers the cost of doing business. Ethics is pro-business and pro-consumer at the same time. <br /><br />Finally, we need a candidate and a team that can change the paradigm of the Presidency--our new President should plan to spend more time on "Seventh Generation" challenges that bear directly on the future of the entire world as well as the future security and prosperity of America seven generations out, and less time on top-level day to day Executive matters. The new Vice President should spend two thirds of their time actually managing the government, and one third training to be President in the future. <br /><br />All this puts power back in the hands of the people, while tackling the tough issues head on.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The federal government has lost its integrity and is totally out of touch with reality.

3038-4049	Redirect Secret Intelligence Toward Open Democratic Intelligence	2009-05-24 00:00:00	I have five longer proposals up, on Electoral, Intelligence, National Security, and Governance Reform, as well as an Open Source Agency that enables the reforms and reconnects citizens to information and power, but it has been suggested I offer a simplified variation for general consideration.<br /><br />1. Stop spending $65 billion a year on secret intelligence that ignores 80% of what can be known in 183 languages (but is not secret), and delivers less than 4% of what the President needs to know, and ZERO to the Cabinet, independent agencies, action officers, and Congress.<br /><br />2. Create a Smart Nation but connecting education, intelligence as decision-support, and research under one "czar" (Colin Powell or Derek Bok or both), using an Open Source Agency to get smart at all levels about using open sources and methods of information collection and sense-making.<br /><br />3. Stop focusing $1 trillion a year on inter-state conflict, which is both least probably and only one of ten high-level threats to humanity (the others are poverty, infectious disease, and environmental degradation above, and below, civil war, genocide, other atrocities, proliferation, terrorism, and transnational crime.<br /><br />4. Use the Open Source Agency to focus on all ten threats by providing decision support across all twelve core policies (Agriculture, Diplomacy, Economy, Education, Energy, Family, Health, Immigration, Justice, Security, Society, Water), and demand that the taxpayer dollars be redirected toward creating prosperity at home and peace abroad.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Our government is both uninformed and out of control. If we are to restore the defining characteristic of the Republic, the people being soverign to and able to abolish the government if it refuses to reform, then we must, as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison knew so well, arm ourselves with information and demand of our government informed decision making in the public interest.<br /><br />President Obama today represents the 30% that voted for him, at the same time that Independents are now 39% of the voting demographic. He has ONE chance to pass Electoral Reform and with the full power of ALL of the people, embracing the 70% that did NOT vote for him, he can be the George Washington of the 21st Century.</div><br />	Robert David STEELE Vivas	10	12	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3038-4049

The last major insurer in Florida, State Farm, has announced it's intention to withdraw and cancel all homeowners policies because of it's inability to sustaine a major loss. When free enerprise is no longer able to to take on the risk, It should then be the governments with its ability to include all the citizens in the law of large numbers to provide relief from exorbinate premiums. THey have done so with the Federal Flood program. The government could still use the independent insurance companies to administer the program as well as adjusting the losses. Buying insurance is one of the major reasons people can't afford to buy new hames or commercial property. FEMA could be utilized to administer this program instead of delivering water and ice to victims which should be the responsibility of the State and local governments.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It would help stimulate people in purchasing property.

3049-4049	Social Security too Slow	2009-05-24 00:00:00	The problem that I see is that Social Security is so far behind in helping people that are disabled for what ever reason, are losing everything including their homes. <br />I feel that if Social Security worked faster that families would be able to keep their homes and it would help the mortgage companies. And since Social Security would have to hire more people it would put more people to work. So to me it would be a win win for a lot of people. <br />It is really sad that so many families lose everything just because someone gets sick and can no long work.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It would do two things. 1 It would help a lot of people that are in great need. 2 That it would put people to work that need it.</div><br />	brett60johnson	6	9	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3049-4049	
3050-4049	Building Consensus via Group Dialog	2009-05-24 00:00:00	The idea here is to implement a dialog between groups using a simple voting-on-messages technology. Each round of the process, participants will write messages and then vote to select one message to represent the group. If there are many messages, the voting has to go in cycles, with random distribution of a few messages to each voter each cycle, and dropping some proportion of the lowest vote getters each time around.<br /><br />To build consensus, a group dialog needs to alternate between "together" and "apart" rounds. In the "apart" rounds each participating group elects its own message. In the "together" rounds, all the participants from all groups elect one message to represent their common humanity across the groups.<br /><br />With this structure, the groups never confront each other in a direct back-and-forth exchange. Rather, communication between the groups is mediated by the common voice of the combined groups. <br /><br />The interesting political possibility here would be to implement an American political dialog with red, blue, purple and green "voices". President Obama could connect with America in a new way by replying to the elected message of the "together" round. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>America needs to get her act together. Also, if this idea works out, we can apply it globally, because we the human race need to get our act together, too.</div><br />	rogerweaton	3	5	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3050-4049	
3051-4049	Design Planning and Decision-Making Processes with “Outreachability” in Mind	2009-05-24 00:00:00	When designing planning and decision-making processes, one of the criteria should be "does this support the level of collaboration to which we aspire?" If differing planning or modeling approaches score similarly for cost effectiveness, relevance, and planner or scientific acceptance, then the approach that lends itself more readily to wider collaboration (and if wider collaboration is a goal), then that approach should be chosen. Likewise, once a planning or scientific approach is chosen, thinking early about each step "how will this support various levels of participation?" will provide for a much stronger synergy between good science, good planning, and good collaboration.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Outreach is part of the decision process, not just an add-on.<br /><br /><br />(Note: we wish there were a category "Collaboration/Agencies - Public." If there were, this is where this comment would belong.)</div><br />	Carie Fox and Philip Murphy	2	5	3	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3051-4049	
3052-4049	Planning and Collaboration Operate from the Same Platform	2009-05-24 00:00:00	Technology gives the public the ability to comment from the same platform as the planners, thus greatly increasing the likelihood that the comments themselves will be salient, that the planners will be able to act on the comments, and that the system (decision-maker and agency) will have a positive reinforcing loop. For instance, if planners are using GIS, then commenters should be able to use GIS in similar ways. Instead of agencies using a tacit (and invisible) decision framework and asking the commenter to guess at the underlying logic of a decision--and planners to guess at the commenters' guesses--make the decision framework explicit and give the commenters access to that.<br /><br />When the agency designs their decision-making process, make it conducive to collaboration* by building outreach and planning upon the same foundation rather than treating outreach as an add-on.<br /><br />*If collaboration is a goal<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>If the public could enter into the complexity of the decision and make input in more powerful ways, the public-agency relationship would have many more of the characteristics of a "learning system." </div><br />	Carie Fox and Philip Murphy	4	7	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3052-4049	
3053-4049	Use Well-designed Feedback Systems instead of Central Control to Improve Web Design	2009-05-24 00:00:00	An efficient and effective way to improve quality of websites without hampering creativity would be… yup, transparency, specifically transparency about how well the website is working for the intended user. There are plenty of examples in the private sector--was this answer useful? How clear/interesting was this page? How easy was it to find what you wanted? The answers to these questions should be available in real time on every federal website. The results of this query should be used in evaluating and rewarding not only the staff directly responsible for the site but also the manager for that unit. <br /><br />In an emerging field, this is a better way to identify and reach excellence than trying to set and enforce national rules.<br /><br />(See also the usage statistics recommendations--excellent!)<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Carie Fox and Philip Murphy	2	4	2	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3053-4049	
3054-4049	Increase teacher pay and enhance recruiting to improve our education system	2009-05-24 00:00:00	We all are aware of how poorly our nation is education our young people to have the skills needed to compete with emerging countries. Most kids do not attend college and many don't even finish high school. Why is that the case in a world where all the low-skilled jobs have moved over seas? I think it's because the government and media have not done a good job informing young people about the importance of education in our society.<br /><br />The government needs to take a lead role in changing the perception of education. The first step is making teachers respected in society. Increase the pay to at least make teaching competitive with business and engineering jobs. <br /><br />I urge every leader in our government to read the book Innovation Nation by John Kao. This book includes some great data on the state of our nation versus other countries like China who are investing in education. I have no relation to the author and no interest in the book; I only want the U.S. to commit to education as a critical element that will enable us to maintain our leadership position among other nations.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The U.S. could be passed up by other more innovative nations in the near future if we don't educate our young people to have the critical math, science and cultural skills to create new products and services. </div><br />	kelly.berger	24	30	6	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3054-4049	
3055-4049	Inreach (within-agency collaboration and shared learning)	2009-05-24 00:00:00	Inreach, interagency dialog, and outreach have many of the same characteristics. It makes sense to (a) treat these as concentric circles, starting with inreach and working out to the general public or (b) treat these as one. All the principles, ethics, aspirations and implementation tools discussed in this site should be designed for application within the agency as well in agency-agency and agency-public dialogs. Overall, this would lead to wiser and more implementable decisions.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Carie Fox and Philip Murphy	7	9	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3055-4049

3057-4049	Report Types of Uncertainty	2009-05-24 00:00:00	In decision-making processes, the type of uncertainty should be identified. Is the system inherently predictable and well known? Is it inherently predictable but not well known (you can give a number, but have to say + or -)? Are important aspects of the situation stochastic (random)? Is the system nonstationary (cannot predict future from the past)? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div><br />Data without reporting of uncertainty may be more misleading than helpful.</div><br />	Carie Fox and Philip Murphy	5	9	4	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3057-4049

3059-4049	When Using Novel, More Accessible Techniques, Advertise In Traditional Media	2009-05-24 00:00:00	Developing novel techniques meant to involve "more than the usual suspects" needs to be teamed with advertisement in more traditional media. People can't come and be excited by a new website unless they know it is there. For instance, did the website include a Spanish version? That's cool, but also not much good unless it was matched with advertisements in Spanish-speakers' newspapers, or flyers and leaflets in their communities.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Generally speaking, technology benefits are leveraged by traditional outreach tools, and vice-versa.</div><br />	Carie Fox and Philip Murphy	6	9	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3059-4049	
3060-4049	Think of New Approaches as Social, Tech & Staff Investments—Long Term	2009-05-24 00:00:00	New approaches, such as collaborative comment analysis or online multi-criteria decision support, are costly. They require an investment by the public in at least two ways (a) learning a new approach/interface and (b) giving the agency their trust that this new approach really will work better. It requires capitol investment. It requires investment in training and practice for staff and management. Agencies should think about new tools and approaches strategically and for the long-term, complete with evaluation and improvement, rather than for a single event or planning process.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div><br /><br />(This idea really belongs in the public-agency collaboration category.)</div><br />	Carie Fox and Philip Murphy	4	5	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3060-4049	
3061-4049	Open-Ended Questions in Requests for Comments	2009-05-24 00:00:00	As a standard of practice, design requests for comments should include open-ended questions.

3062-4049	End Media Monopolies	2009-05-24 00:00:00	Mass media misinformation campaigns have controlled the American public opinion for too long. It's no secret that the media is controlled by a handful of rich and powerful companies which only present the "facts" as they want them to be viewed. The faces and voices we see and hear are only those approved and influenced by lobbyist, government officials, corporations and other private interest groups that control and manage information behind the scenes. Objectivity is laughable at best. The media is only public when the public has both access and the ability to contribute to what is being seen, said and heard. How many times do you hear an independent reporter on the news? The media was meant to present different perspectives on issues so people could gather the "facts" and form their own opinions. The media was meant to be a check and balance not a lap dog for government policies and officials.

3063-4049	Allow Agencies to Survey Public Without Central Review of Survey Instruments	2009-05-24 00:00:00	Engineers do not send all their engineering plans to a central engineer reviewer. Agencies rightly implement NEPA differently. Why is there one central review system for surveying of the public? There are many better systems for supporting quality.<br /><br />The tools for transparency will evolve so rapidly that a year-long lag in corresponding evaluation systems just won't work. <br /><br />This is all the more essential since any interactive system appears to be a "survey" under the Paperwork Reduction Act.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Carie Fox and Philip Murphy	7	11	4	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3063-4049	
3064-4049	Use Good Collaboration Practices in Web and other Technology Design	2009-05-24 00:00:00	Mediators, facilitators and other professionals have a well-developed set of principles about transparency, participation, and collaboration. Use them.<br /><br />Examples: <br />-apply principles of active listening to comment analysis<br />-apply principles of interest-based negotiation in development of interactive websites, for instance by using multi-criteria decision analysis (in part) to help people distinguish between positions (alternatives) and interests (criteria)<br />-assist people in discriminating between values (policy) and science, for instance by using multi-criteria decision analysis and giving people the chance to "play with" their values and experience the intersection of values and ratings in a practical context<br />-consistently consider "process, substance and relationship" issues in the design of online interactions<br />-develop models collaboratively<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div><br />There are many excellent posts about collaboration principles; the separate point here is the goal of applying those principles in technology design.</div><br />	Carie Fox and Philip Murphy	21	22	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3064-4049	
3065-4049	Free Obama (No Kidding)	2009-05-24 00:00:00	I spent the morning reading every single posted idea, many of the comments, and then posted my own five ideas and thought to leave it at that. However, during the mowing of the lawn it came to me. Idea first, then the short explanation<br /><br />Free Obama. Simple, straight-forward, and the ONE THING that we can all focus on to achieve ALL of the ideas posted so far. <br /><br />Right now, President Barack Obama is president in name only. He is being guided, controlled, constrained, influenced, lied to--by whatever attribute one might wish, he is anything but free. He is also, according to one of my sources, mindful of being assassinated if he attempts too radical a departure from the agenda that has been set for him by Wall Street and the four big complexes that own the US federal government: Wall Street fronted by the Fed and Treasury, military-intelligence, prison-slavery, and hospital-pharamaceutical.<br /><br />There can be no more telling proof of the validity of my concern for his well-being that the fact thatupon entering office he immediately abandoned what little status he had given to non-partisan, post-partisan, trans-partisan, and immediately became the puppet of the winner-take-all Democratic mafia who--this is the important bit--place higher importance on keeping the two-party monopoly of power alive, than they do on serving the public.<br /><br />FACT: Obama was elected by 30% of the eligible voters. 56.4 or so of those eligible voted, with a bare majority within that number. 70% of us did not vote for him.<br /><br />FACT: 39% of eligible voters are now Independent, with the Democratic party falling to 33% and the Republican Party to the mid 20% range.<br /><br />FACT: The two party criminal system controls every aspect of the election process and has betrayed the public trust in gerrymandering and manipulating all aspects so as to keep incumbents in power and deny Independents access to debates at any level.<br /><br />FACT: Secrecy in Washington is used to keep power in the hands of those who have betrayed the public trust, from Senators and Representatives to intelligence officials doing warrantless wiretapping and torture, to contractors cheating the military.<br /><br />FACT: I put a memorandum under Obama's door in Des Moines, with the gentle support of the hotel staff which gave me a room next to his despite the hotel being sold out, and the Secret Service detail, to whom I introduced myself. That memorandum told him two things:<br /><br />A) You have to embrace all the parties, not just the two criminal parties. The Libertarians, Greens, Reforms, Independents, and even the Socialists. Diversity matters, inclusiveness matters. Re-establish democracy in America.<br /><br />B) You cannot allow Congress, lobbyists, or Wall Street to set the agenda. You need to have a strategic analytic model that mandates a coherent strategy for addressing all ten high-level threats to humanity across all twelve core policy areas, while doing outreach to the eight demographic challengers that will set the future. Without the model, you will be bounced off the walls.<br /><br />And so it came to pass. In his first 100 days Obama turned into a look-alike of George Bush, "going along" with the idiocy of bailing out Wall Street, surging in Afghanistan, keeping Guantanamo open, and so on. He is not well-informed, he is not in charge, and at this rate he will be the stake in the heart of the Democratic Party that Dick Cheney was to the Republican Party. Who would have thought...<br /><br />So I say, FREE OBAMA. Make it a bumper sticker. Make it a meme. He needs to know that 100% is a lot better than 30%, and that 100% is achievable if he will BE President to We the People, not to those who lied, cheated, and bought (still waiting for the accounting on that last $300 million) the election for him.<br /><br />Captive to others? Right now, yes. BE the President, pass Electoral Reform in time for 2010, and lead America back to its Constitutional greatness as a Republic Of, By, and For We the People.<br /><br />WHO IS Robert David STEELE Vivas to say something so utterly outrageous?<br /><br />Recovering spy, #1 Amazon reviewer for non-fiction, CEO of OSS.Net and Earth Intelligence Network.<br />Learn more at www.oss.net and www.earth-intelligence.net which was created to give Obama the model.<br />All of my books are free online as well as on sale at Amazon, the three I recommend for citizens are:<br />NEW CRAFT OF INTELLIGENCE: Personal, Public, & Political at www.oss.net/BOOKS<br />COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace at www.oss.net/CIB<br />ELECTION 2008: Lipstick on the Pig at www.oss.net/PIG with an annotated bibliography of 500+ books on reality<br /><br />I pray for this country every day. We need to reach Obama in a way that no one close to him is capable of comprehending because with the exception of his wife, everyone around him is in love with power, not the USA.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Short of a general strike and the secession of Alaska, Hawaii, Vermont, New Hamshire and perhaps Oklahoma, Montana, and Texas, there is only one person in America who can free Obama. Himself. I'd like him to know that if he does break free of the phonies and criminals and partisan hacks that have isolated him from all of us, that We the People will give him back a Congress of free thinkers whose primary attribute will be INTEGRITY.<br /><br />Free Obama.</div><br />	Robert David STEELE Vivas	8	19	11	41	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3065-4049

3067-4049	Change Legal Perception of Spammers, Junkmailers, & Telemarketeers	2009-05-24 00:00:00	Here's the basis of my opinion.<br /><br />It is illegal to use another's money - time - resources without their permission, to do so is considered a THEFT OF SERVICE.<br /><br />To deny the same Individual the use of his own resources is a DENIAL OF SERVICE.<br /><br />To intrude on an Individual's Privacy is a Constitutional Violation.<br /><br />Now, to address Spammers, Telemarketers, and Junk Mailers - ATTENTION JUDGES!!!!! - FREE SPEECH CAN BE WITHHELD IF YOU'RE COMMITTING A CRIME IN DOING SO!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Free speech rights pertains to public forums ONLY.<br /><br />In other words when a telemarketer calls, its a crime for what he is doing is a DENIAL OF SERVICE for the Owner of the phone - He can't receive his desired communications. A DENIAL OF SERVICE IN THE COMPUTER WORLD GETS 20 YEARS. It is no less of a crime to do it on a phone - AND THERE IS NO LEGAL DIFFERENCE!!!.<br /><br />Also THEFT OF SERVICE charges apply. The Telemarketer is accessing personal resources / equipment WITHOUT PERMISSION WHICH CONSTITUTES THEFT OF SERVICE. This misconception of Telemarketer's rights originated back when Ma Bell owned all Phone Equipment and was a public service.<br /><br />THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE AND EXISTING LAWS NEED TO BE ENFORCED.<br /><br />The individual pays, and maintains phone and computer for SELF USE ONLY and it is NOT Public Equipment / Resources which can be used without permission - to do so is ALSO an invasion of privacy and is NOT a public forum where free speech rights are guaranteed.<br /><br />The ONLY phones Telemarketers have a right to are PAY PHONES for they are public property.<br /><br />The same applies to the internet and computers. To Impede and disrupt the effectiveness of an individuals resources with spam, forcebly recording it on equipment NOT OWNED BY THE SPAMMER and NOT PUBLIC EQUIPMENT, violating the individuals privacy, STEALING RESOURCES OF MONETARY VALUE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO DEAL WITH IT is Illegal. The Same as DENIAL OF SERVICE.<br /><br />Spammers are COMMITING CRIMES IN NON PUBLIC FORUMS IN ORDER TO "PROMOTE THEIR FREE SPEECH".<br /><br />Because of the violations of other individuals personal rights and the theft of resources - THEIR RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH IN THIS MANNER MAY BE CONSTITUTIONALLY DENIED!!!! For where these instances of attempted free speech are being done is NOT a public Forum, NOT a public owned resource where free speech is guaranteed. So In doing so, FREE SPEECH RIGHTS DO NOT APPLY.<br /><br />Now on the subject of Junk Mail If I take my junkmail over to the mall plaza and go to throw it in the garbage dumpster, a sign on the dumpster says $2500 theft of service charge will be applied to unauthorized use.<br /><br />Here's the clincher - There's NO DIFFERENCE between dumping junkmail in the dumpster or in my mailbox Legally.<br /><br />Once again the mailbox was put there for my personal use, personally paid for and maintained. To receive desired communications which I ORIGINATE / ELECT to receive.<br /><br />The use of which unsolicited QUALIFYS AS A THEFT OF SERVICE OR A THEFT OF RESOURCES.<br />The time an individual has to take to deal with junkmail has monetary value - the stealing of which is a crime when unsolicited.<br /><br />People go AWWW it only takes a second to deal with it, but tell the family who didn't have a Living room when they saved all their junkmail for a year.<br /><br />So according to junkmailers it's legal for me to contract the post office or other delivery service to deliver junk cars, debris, unwanted building product, refuse, to the white house to deal with at THEIR EXPENSE.<br /><br />When you start talking of the expense of constantly dealing with large debris such as cars it WOULD get expensive and would be an OUTRIGHT THEFT of their resources, money and time<br /><br />THERE IS NO LEGAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND WHAT HAPPENS EVERYDAY AT MY MAILBOX<br /><br />Just because you can pay to have something delivered does NOT mean in any form is legal.<br /><br />Here's How privacy is supposed to work, I want to buy a car, so I go online and elect to receive solicitations for a period of 1 to 3 months after which my privacy rights are reenacted and all junk mail MUST stop. None of this electing to receive mail from partners crap, where they just change their name and solicit again, the individual must have elected to receive directly (They just keep changing their name saying they are a partner to which you subscribed) Only legal communications are solicited.<br /><br />The ONLY constitutionally legal means of advertising are newspapers, TV, magazines etc. where the individual ELECTS to purchase said content KNOWING it contains advertising.<br /><br />This is where the lobbying of politicians has been paying off.<br /><br />Sad Part is almost everybody doesn't realize their privacy rights AND USE OF their resources are being ignored in the SUPPOSED legal form of free speech.<br /><br /><br />Once again, Free Speech rights CANNOT be claimed when a CRIME IS BEING COMMITTED IN A NON- PUBLIC AND NON-PUBLIC OWNED FORUM.<br /><br />The constitution doesn't say anything about jumping through hoops and spending large amounts of money to deny junkmail, spamming, telemarketers to receive privacy rights and right to limit use of PERSONAL RESOURCES to oneself. And the large bulk of spam together, and telemarketers constitutes harrasment<br /><br />THE JUDGES AND LAWYERS HAVE THE TEETH TO DEAL WITH BUT REFUSE TO USE against spammers, telemarketers, and Junkmailers.<br /><br />Time to vote some one in who'll enforce existing laws WHICH ARE ADEQUATE.<br /><br />The garbage in garbage dumps will decrease 2/3's - Fewer trees will need to be cut protecting our resources<br />Privacy will finally be done and decided by who it's intended for - the individual himself and these problems will have been dealt with according to the Constitution - WHAT A CONCEPT!!!<br /><br />And the penalty to those commiting these crimes? Payback of all the man hours dealing with their garbage, Uh, let's see, 10 million incidents of spam time times taking each individual's monetary valued time of 1 minute to deal with it its............LIFE IN PRISON!!!!!!<br /><br />get the picture?Huh<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Existing Laws are enough to deal with these Problems but the perception of Free Speech Rights for Spammers, Telemarketeers & Junkmailers has been Incorrect.</div><br />	Kevin Short	14	24	10	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3067-4049	
3068-4049	Nuclear Waste Disposal	2009-05-24 00:00:00	I have studied our Earth's Problems over the years and have come up with some Ideas to solve them.<br /><br />FACTS:<br /><br />It will cost Trillions and Trillions of dollars to maintain & guard Nuclear Waste against Terrorists / Pollution for the Waste's half-life of 1,000 YEARS OR MORE.<br /><br />The Space Shuttle Program, Space Station & Space Exploration Projects are HURTING for Money.<br /><br />There is actually NO SAFE PLACE ON EARTH to store Nuclear Waste for 1,000 YEARS OR MORE!<br /><br />With our Modern Capabilities we can build Explosion Proof Containers.<br /><br />MY PROPOSED SOLUTION:<br /><br />Send with every Shuttle Launch a container or Radioactive Waste to the Space Station.<br /><br />They collect the Containers and when enough are Present, Strap them together with a rocket and send them off on a capture orbit to the moon.<br /><br />Doesn't matter how fast they go, just so they end up on the Moon. Would be nice if they end up in about one place.<br /><br />This accomplishes 3 things:<br /><br />We won't have to pay Trillions to store AND GUARD for 1,000 years with terrorists/pollution risks - it would cost only a few million.

3070-4049	Depletion of Essential Nonrenewable Resources	2009-05-24 00:00:00	Excerpt from the Inaugural Address by President Barack Obama, Jan. 20, 2009:<br /><br />' . . . and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders . . . . NOR CAN WE CONSUME THE WORLD'S RESOURCES WITHOUT REGARD TO EFFECT. FOR THE WORLD HAS CHANGED, AND WE MUST CHANGE WITH IT.' (emphasis added)<br /><br />The President's concern about the pace at which the world and the United States consume their reserves of industrial-base resources, specifically resources that are nonrenewable and accessible in finite and diminishing reserves strongly suggests replenishing essential resources that will be lost to future generations is an increasingly predictable fact, with significant 'EFFECT' on the United States and the world's economies and quality of life.<br /><br />The reality of the dilemma posed by the President is close enough to be in our forseeable future; further, that upon its arrival, will be with us indefinitely. Therefore, the dilemma qualifies for 'Open Government' discussion insofar as 'depletion of nonrenewable resources' can be defined and the 'effect' that will apply worldwide is understood. The issue deserves cross feed now through an 'Open Government' dialogue, 'brainstorm.' or other form of group collaboration, comment and documentation. It warrants being considered in the context of 'climate change' and perhaps still another 'economic disaster' redux.'<br /><br />Several years ago I wrote a layman-level future history on the same subject, now a blog at:<br /><br />http://scribe1917x.livejournal.com/4923.html<br /><br />I also tried to interest young folks by extrapolating the eventual 'nonrenewables' dilemma and relevant technologies in an sf format that can be freely downloaded from the Gutenberg Archive at:<br /><br />http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/18257<br /><br />'Mike' Moldeven<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The forseeable depletion of the world's nonrenewable resources (minerals, rare earths, and other 'natural-source' substances is supported by many experts. The only remaining source will be 'space.' Pres Obama mentioned 'effect' of the above in his Inagaugural Speech.

Along with the rainforest losses, we have the loss of earth's capability to clean and convert co2 and release the oxygen into our atmosphere causing not as much moisture in the air to diffuse and dissipate sunlight before it hits our oceans. <br /><br />This means the oceans get warmer. More sunlight on the Warmer Oceans means they will fuel dramatically stronger hurricanes, & tornadoes due to the more dramatic temperature differences. <br /><br />At the same time, water to condense into a liquid requires a particle of dirt or pollution. With the higher ratios of pollution it means the water condenses sooner than it would in a pristine environment - meaning the moisture under current conditions stays in the atmosphere for shorter and shorter time periods. <br /><br />Once again causing the spread of larger and larger arid low moisture fronts causing more violent storms and conditions.<br /><br />They're pushing exotic cures and IGNORING THE FACT THAT NEARLY 2/3 OF OUR PREVIOUS LARGE TREE POPULATIONS ARE DEAD!!!!<br /><br />Large companies should have a yearly tax to give free seedlings to surrounding Landowners to reduce their carbon footprint - enough to clean and offset their atmospheric output.<br /><br />All Properties in the cities not meeting a certain tree ratio normally found in the countryside should have a TAX FOR THIS PURPOSE ALSO TO SUPPLY FREE SEEDLINGS TO LANDOWNERS IN THE SUBURBS to reduce pollution and acquire better air quality around the cities.<br /><br />Regardless of the commercial ALL OF THEM SHOULD BE PROMOTING PLANTING LARGE TREES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />{commercials}<br /><br />"PLANT LARGE TREES!!!!!.............buy a hybrid<br /><br />"PLANT LARGE TREES!!!!!............Install solar panels<br /><br />"PLANT LARGE TREES!!!!!...........reduce emissions<br /><br />"GOING GREEN ISN'T ENOUGH - PLANT LARGE TREES!!!!"<br /><br />"Houston! we HAVE A PROBLEM!!!

3074-4049	Food Modernization Act of 2009: Preventing Seed Monopolies For Family Farms	2009-05-24 00:00:00	The cleaning, storing, and collection of seeds could become a thing of the past according to the Organic Consumers Association. Apparently, Monsanto has been attempting to corner the market on seed sources and patenting everything it can get its hands on. They aren't the only big agriculture company to do so. Basically it goes like this. Farmers sign an agreement to plant Monsanto seeds, the Genetically Modified seeds have pesticides in them. Just before the plants mature, the seeds are triggered to become impotent, therefore farmers must buy seeds every year. <br />Not only that, they have been suing farmers even if something happens to blow in their crops and alters the original seeds. This is a problem for me as I collect seeds myself. This is way too complicated and unfortunately the word is that there are a lot of senators in the back pockets of these companies. Although we need to protect our food supply, I cannot believe that this topic has not been addressed and studied more thoroughly. <br />Is it right that the a former Monsanto big wig should be running the USDA? I have a real problem with that. The USDA is not the place for a former Monsanto employee. Only an organic farmer is going to make sure that the pesticides and GM food is not going to be promoted by the USDA. I was hoping for an email address for Michelle, as I know she is also a home gardener? <br />I have written to my congressman, senators, and governor, and they share the same concerns. Some states are already under the spell of Monsanto, luckily my state is not as of yet. <br />My say: Make it illegal for private entities to collect, monitor, harass, intimidate, or monopolize on any and all food distribution techniques. Monsanto and others should be monitored and be accountable for these practices, and for their attempts to deny people from quality GM-free seed sources. The USDA needs to find out if there is a way to protect our food sources by distributing organic seeds. The Food Modernization Act of 2009, needs to be carefully written to address these issues.<br /> http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_16844.cfm<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea is important as the Food Modernization Act of 2009 is set to pass without any protection for organic farmers or protection from trumped up lawsuits. This is as much of a danger to our food sources as intentionally tainted products.</div><br />	nh.deering	47	49	2	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3074-4049

Instead of sharing our views of reality, we put forth our view as the "right" one and stir defenses in our listeners. <br /><br />So we relationship therapists model and teach stopping this. I believe that the problem of MasterTalk is so great, and common, that the easiest way to shift the most people into being respectful and dialogical is to model it. Our present administration would be a great place to start this. <br /><br />I believe Barack Obama already "almost" completely understands this. Therefore I want an explicit project to teach all government employees to avoid MasterTalk and to easily validate others, and to teach how to do this explicity.<br /><br />I have written on this extensively.

3078-4049	End Corporate Influence/Control of Our Government	2009-05-24 00:00:00	Due to a clerical error in the Supreme Court header notes of a decision made in the late 1800s, corporations have been granted all the rights of people. Legally speaking, they've been given "personhood" and therefore are entitled to all the rights of citizens enshrined in the Constitution, except for the right to vote.<br />Consequently, corporations have been granted the right to "freedom of speech" which our founders had never envisioned. Furthermore, their ability to spend their economic resources in electoral politics has been determined to be an exercise of their free speech.<br />Because corporations hold far more wealth than all the human citizens of the U.S. combined, they have massive undue influence in our electoral and political process. As a result, government often acts to benefit corporations and at the expense of the public.<br />Over the years, giant corporations have continued to consolidate their power and control of our political system, our media, our educational system, our economy, our public institutions and even over the non-profit sector and our leisure and entertainment.<br />This has not been good for our society, for our livelihoods, or for our government. If this trend is not stopped very soon, we will reach a point where it cannot be rolled back.<br />The solution doesn't have to be complex. Revoking corporate "personhood" and enforcing existing laws would be a start.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This is important because the interests of corporations are frequently at odds with the public interest, and often are entirely contrary to the public health and public good. Many, if not most, of these monstrous corporations are not even based in the US, so their interests have little to do with the national interest, and their actions may, in fact, benefit other nations while harming US interests. Also, although having the rights of people, corporations do not tend to get old or die (but rather merge and become stronger), they do not need to breathe clean air or drink clean water, they can and do commit crimes but cannot be imprisoned, they have no children or grandchildren to care about, but rather focus all of their attention upon maximizing profits for the short-term. These are not the forces that should be controlling our government, and we need to make sure they stay far, far away from our political system. Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, and Teddy Roosevelt all warned us about the democratically destructive power of corporations. Even today, we have yet to heed their wisdom. We cannot afford to wait any longer. We need to end corporate meddling in our political system NOW.</div><br />	toddputnam	125	132	7	6	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3078-4049	
3080-4049	Comment Feedback System—Comment Analysis and Summarization	2009-05-24 00:00:00	Many of the suggestions on this site would increase the public's access to government and the ability to provide feedback on government proposals. But what is the government going to do with all those comments? <br /><br />The current comment analysis technology fails to create a "learning system." To be a learning system, the government's response to the public comment has to be timely, interesting, and relevant ("this is what we heard, and this is how it influenced us"). A commenter must be able to trace her comment directly to the summary and from the summary back to the original comments. And the summaries themselves must capture the passion in the comments as well as the "facts." One challenge is to deal with repeat comments without losing the texture and depth of the public narrative.<br /><br />Government needs to invest in radically different technologies for analyzing and summarizing comments. The approaches, as well as being more effective and efficient, could run the gamut from transparency to full collaboration. For more information about one such emerging technology, capable of being used as appropriate throughout the full transparency/collaboration range, see <br />http://www.infoharvest.com/ihroot/infoharv/docs/NAEP%20comment%20analysis%20v1.pdf<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Carie Fox and Philip Murphy	19	22	3	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3080-4049	
3081-4049	Make certain the emerging "New World Order" has truly democratic accountability	2009-05-24 00:00:00	The US government, along with numerous other governments around the world, has been planning and implementing measures over the years to usher in what Bush Sr., Clinton, and Bush Jr. have all referred to as a "New World Order (NWO)." Candid comments from other numerous government officials about plans for the NWO suggest that this it will essentially be a single, global governing body that will govern all nations.<br />Yes, this does sound like a very ambitious undertaking, but we have been assured repeatedly that plans are moving forward and that once the global leader, the U.S., is willing to drop down a few rungs to be on par with other nations, the plan will be quickly implemented.<br />My concern is that, because this plan tends to be rather secretive and is not covered by our media, we have no way of knowing whether this new governing body intends to be democratic or an aristocracy. Because the known interests behind the formation of the New World Order tend to be the richest of the rich corporate elite (like Rockefeller and other Wall Street titans), they already represent an elite aristocracy.<br />I agree that if this NWO ends wars and poverty, and restores environmental sanity, that is good. But if in doing so it strips us of our democratic freedoms, I'm not sure I agree. Besides, many of these same corporate elite have been responsible for much of the environmental destruction, global exploitation and poverty, and supporters of wars. Consequently, I am a bit concerned about who will be running the show, and whether the global populace will have some sort of veto power, because I believe that the interests of the Rockefellers are not the interests of the average person.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Plans are afoot to bring all nations together under one global government. To achieve this monumental task will require some concessions, like "national sovereignty." A people, such as we Americans, are not likely to relinquish such hard-won freedoms unless we are really, really pushed --pushed hard.<br />So, yes, that means there will be some orchestrated hard times ahead to get all Americans to accept the new order of things. But, assuming we get there and become a part of this New World Order, how can we know it will be democratic and operate in the best interests of a particular population? Without accountability, we are possibly looking at an aristocratic dictatorship. I, for one, vote for accountability.

3086-4049	A measurement of government transparency	2009-05-24 00:00:00	Government secrecy should be a temporary measure to enable an operation that would be jeopardized if opponents were aware of the intent and plans in advance. Once the operation has been completed, U. S. citizens have the right to know what the government has done and can hold the administration accountable for its actions. The entire concept of government transparency is that if an administration commits actions that may be in contradiction to the basic principles of our government, U.S. citizens and the world have the right to know. In instances where legal action against individuals who engaged in a government operation is intended, the release of information should be decided by a judge, and based only on criteria for a fair trial.<br /><br />We can measure government transparency by identifying government operations that have been completed but the information has not been available for release to the public. When these are not released to the public we have the right to know why and the government agency withholding information should be required to give reasons under FOIA.<br /><br />For example, events such as the abuse and torture of prisoners at Guantanamo and other prisons fall into this category. The events occurred in the past, we hopefully have no intention of continuing the practice. The government is failing to release memos regarding these actions because of world perception of our country's level of respect for the rights of and responsibilities to citizens of other countries. <br /><br />1. The operation was completed.<br />2. No similar operations will be jeopardized by disclosing the information.<br />3. No technical information currently requiring security clearances would need to be disclosed. <br />4. Failure to disclose has as a primary reason a desire to hide morally and legally questionable decisions.<br /><br />Any instances of information withheld after passing these criteria is a measure of lack of government transparency. The over-riding principle must be that all information is released unless it clearly jeopardizes in a specific way a specific current or planned operation.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>We need to have an open dialogue on establishing standards for the release of information to the public. For too long, the criteria have been arbitrary and self-serving. Failure to disclose information for fear of the consequences of disclosure of acts that violate our standards as an humane, law abiding nation dooms us to repeat those acts. Secrecy in government operations will cause us to travel a path that will leave a legacy of disaffection from government and shame throughout the world.</div><br />	mkricker	3	8	5	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3086-4049

3103-4049	Enhance Data.gov's value by adding link to ICR where appropriate	2009-05-24 00:00:00	As Data.gov becomes populated with data sets that can be sliced, diced, and linked, valuable mashups and other non-federally developed applications are likely to result. However, adding to Data.gov what is essentially an additional layer of metadata - the Information Collection Request - could enable a second value chain that might become just as significant. This additional information can be provided merely by posting the URL to the Information Collection Request with the dataset, where applicable.<br /><br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />An Information Collection Request exists in cases where federal data sets involve collection from non-federal organizations or individuals. The "OMB Number" at the bottom of a form, such as a tax return, application for benefits, or survey, denotes OMB approval of the form's use by an agency as a vehicle for collecting information. The agency has to show OMB that the information is necessary in order to administer benefits, monitor compliance, improve customer service, etc. Citations and policy memos about the process are to be found at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg_infocoll/#icr. A Fed-centric view of federal agency clearance activity can be found at http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain. The addition of the citizen-centric view to Data.gov would enable even greater transparency and create the conditions for engaging citizens including federal employees more deeply - possibly resulting in insights that would enable agencies and OMB to make public data collection more effective in support of performance improvement. <br /> <br /><br />IMPLEMENTION <br /><br />For every Data.gov dataset that is a result of public submission of information to an agency, post the public URL to the OMB-approved Information Collection Request that pertains to that data set. <br /><br /><br />EXAMPLE<br /><br />The School File that is refreshed weekly at<br />http://www.ed.gov/offices/OSFAP/PEPS/dataextracts.html<br /><br />is authorized by an approved Information Collection Request HERE:<br />http://edicsweb.ed.gov/browse/browsecoll.cfm?pkg_serial_num=38<br /><br />If the School File is posted to Data.gov, the preceding URL should be made available with the file layout, codebook, and other metadata.<br /><br />(Why is this one posted weekly? Because it provides facts that public stakeholders need about the current eligibility of colleges, universities, and career schools to administer Pell Grants and student loans. Such eligibility is dynamic. The dataset reflects both the newest data provided by the school and the current eligibility status of the school.)<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>BENEFITS<br /><br />Every Information Collection Request approval package includes a Supporting Statement that explains in plain English why the information is being collected, from whom, under what conditions, how often, and so on. Such requests are made available for public comment in the Federal Register before they are approved, and are available on each agency's website. Bundling them with the related dataset and its metadata on Data.gov would:<br /><br />* Help public data users understand what government is doing, and why<br /> <br />* Provide self-service, so that subsequent contact with agency is more valuable for both parties<br /><br />* Enable more competent use of the data by more citizens<br /><br />* Facilitate knowledge transfer as federal information management and data experts retire and are hired<br /><br />* Invite new understanding of potential interrelationships among datasets held by different agencies and components within an agency</div><br />	Kitty Wooley	12	13	1	5	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3103-4049

I feel like fewer people than one would think could even tell you who their congressman is, let alone their county assemblyman, or district judge.<br />I think that if people were more involved in their local politics than they would be more inclined to see which issues are on the floor in congress, and might feel open to telling their local congressmen or senators what they think. <br />I propose the Federal Government create a one-stop database where people can look up their elected officials, all the way down to their town and county officials.

3110-4049	The State of Grace Document: A Self Created Tool Used Around the World to Make it Easier to be Transparent and Trust when Collab	2009-05-24 00:00:00	www.stateofgracedocument.com<br /><br />WHAT IS IT?<br />The State of Grace Document is a new way to build, sustain and transition business and personal relationships with trust and respect. You personally write it along with those involved, preferably at the beginning of the relationship. It captures what draws each individual to the situation, your personal preferences and expectations; and it provides a path back to peace if the need arises. It is often being used to replace or enhance traditional legal contracts.<br /><br />THE 5 COMPONENTS OF A STATE OF GRACE DOCUMENT<br />1. The Story of Us --  Share what draws you to these people and this situation. <br />2. Interaction Styles and Warning Signs --  The "blueprint of me," how I work best, what I look like on a good day/bad day, and what I might need that I couldn't ask for in the moment.<br />3. Expectations --  Core values and non-negotiables, the structure you need to create and sustain this relationship.<br />4. Questions to Return to Peace --  A tool to return to peace if the need arises, makes the difficult times shorter and easier.<br />5. Long-Term Timeframe --  How long you're willing to go before you make peace. An agreement of no outright harm, a willingness to keep an open window if the unimaginable happens.<br /><br />WHO'S USING IT AND WHEN<br />The State of Grace Document is currently being used in communities, corporations, small businesses, non-profits, government agencies, churches, families, schools, between boards of directors, project teams, coalitions, business partners, couples, friends, siblings, etc. in countries around the world. Because it is a framework upon which to share the "blueprint of me" with others, it can be used within any relationship situation that exists, and with as many people as are involved. It creates effortless communication and easy day-to-day interactions that reduce stress and enhance overall emotional and physical health. People around the globe say it is an idea whose time has come. <br /><br />Visit the website (www.StateOfGraceDocument.com) to download sample Documents and learn to create your own.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Collaboration and transparency begin and are maintained through trust. The State of Grace Document creates a foundation for individuals and organizations to begin to trust at the deepest levels. It's a simple structure that can be done by people of all ages in every relationship situation you can imagine. It is currently being used in 50+ countries around the world, oftentimes to enhance legal contracts.<br /><br />If 100 people are going to be working on a project together, we are more apt to trust others, and less apt to step on each others toes, if we exchange "the blueprint of me" as we move forward. There are extremely easy to follow Quick Start Guides to download off the website to help people create their own Documents.

3112-4049	Support & Facilitate Public-Government Collaboration with a Participatory Governance Policy	2009-05-24 00:00:00	We now have the capacity to support direct collaboration between the public and government through the use of wikis etc (and by 'collaboration' I mean actual co-creation of content between public and government participants).<br /><br />Collaboration is ostensibly the final phase of this initiative regarding the statement on Whitehouse.gov/open/blog (THU, MAY 21), "On June 15th, we will invite you to use a wiki to draft recommendations in collaborative fashion." However this leaves out the all important public-government collaborative opportunity, with the public only collaborating amongst themselves (unless this statement does not reflect the fullness of the current plan).<br /><br />What we now need is for government to join in the collaborative effort genuinely and openly. I know this level of collaboration is possible because I've seen it first hand at FutureMelbourne.com.au - the ten year plan for the City of Melbourne (Australia) that collaboratively engaged the city's planners, managers, stakeholders and the wider global public. (Full disclosure: my company Collabforge provided consulting and IT development to the City of Melbourne on this project.)<br /><br />So the idea is this: build capacity towards true participatory governance across the nation through the development of a federal policy on public-government collaboration.<br /><br />This policy should boldly chart a course for the nation with a formalized conception of this new opportunity, as well as providing guidelines and strategic considerations for agencies who wish to participate.<br /><br />Such a policy would enable any number of agencies (federal, state, local) to enter this space in a way that is simultaneously coordinated across all levels of government, and, decentralized so that it makes the most sense for the individual agencies applying it.<br /><br />Note: the trouble I had categorizing this idea reflects its need - under the 'Collaboration' category, there is no appropriate place for public-government collaboration!<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Direct public-government collaboration enables the public to represent their ideas and interests in an applied fashion (as opposed to only in review and critique). This engenders a mindset towards constructive input, an increased sense of shared ownership, buy-in and voluntary compliance - because those involved are *truly* involved, not just commenting from the ring-side. And perhaps most importantly, it not only cultivates, but entails a shared learning experience, the result of which is the creation of shared understandings.</div><br />	mark.elliott	26	30	4	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3112-4049	
3113-4049	Set Standards for Government Contracts, THEN Allow Open Bidding	2009-05-24 00:00:00	I think it just as important to control quality as to contain costs, so I would recommend that the federal government require all private contractors to meet a set of health, safety, and environment care standards similar to its own internal standards--whether this be in the United States or overseas. <br /><br />After working as a contract wildland firefighter and as a Americorps forestry volunteer (separately), I have seen very different sets of standards being enforced with private contractors, compared to agency standards. As a somewhat worrying trend, government agencies under the Bush Administration sought to increasing privatize government services that the US Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management typically carried out. These private contractors had very different standards (much lower, generally) than the federal government and frequently violated work and safety standards. For example, wildland firefighters are increasingly at risk due to poor rest to work ratios, that can result in poor judgment, work injuries, and loss of life in some instances due to lack of sleep. I have seen firefighters falling asleep on the fireline and experienced dehydration/heat exhaustion due to improper access to drinking water in high temperatures (100F+) in full sun. While this particular fire was on privately-owned land, I have heard similar accounts of poor working conditions on small-medium federal fires, including sexual harassment. In federal agencies, such work conditions would never be permitted, and safety checks are regularly performed. <br /><br />I think the federal government should require all bidding contractors to sign on to best practice federal work policies, BEFORE the start of the bidding process and agree to monitoring by a federal representative.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea is vital to maintaining adequate protection for any private contractor's employees, any environment they might be working in, and relevant public revenues. </div><br />	spiral_winddancer	31	32	1	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3113-4049

3115-4049	Engage Citizens in Defining the Results They Want for the Country	2009-05-25 00:00:00	For decades, public officials at all levels have preached "measuring public performance" and "managing for results." At the federal level, Congress mandated planning, targeting, & reporting measurable results with the Government Performance & Results Act" of 1993.<br /><br />But "performance" and "results" are usually either defined by bureaucrats whose comfort level is to avoid change, or policy officials with their own pre-set agenda. Going beyond government performance to the conditions of our nation and communities, we are too often asked to accept a small number of standard indicators (e.g., gross domestic product) to tell us whether things are getting better or worse. Citizens do not have to be technical experts to become involved in defining what "results" are important to them, which can be turned into measurable indicators. The government--or an independent nonpartisan organization funded by government--would collect and publish data on an open, user-friendly website. The website would also link each indicator to a description of what citizen-defined priority result it measures, and the process used to engage people in defining that "result." <br />That way, the success of government and the progress of the country will be measured against what matters most to people.<br /><br />There are some good models for engaging people in defining results at the local level (e.g., see the book RESULTS THAT MATTER or http://resultsthatmatter.net on the web), which can be scaled up to the national level using current technologies (e.g., those of AmericaSpeaks, or deliberative versions of social networking). Also, approaches can be borrowed from many of the "Community Indicators" projects around the country & the world (see http://www.communityindicators.net/) and from the "State of the USA" national indicators project (see http://stateoftheusa.org/index.asp).<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>All too often, public policy is driven by politicians' or well-financed interest groups' definitions of "success," and government operations are driven by bureaucrats' definitions of "performance," with little connection to the results most people want to see. This idea would establish an open, accountable way to assure that the success of government and the progress of the country will be measured against what matters most to people.</div><br />	paul	33	35	2	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3115-4049	
3117-4049	Use a Whole Systems Approach to Transparency and Open Government	2009-05-25 00:00:00	One of the major challenges with large initiatives (such as this Transparency and Open Government initiative) and large organizations/institutions (such as the Federal Government) is the lack of integration, collaboration, and synergy that usually result from trying to design, implement, and manage anything this large and complex. They are typically designed and implemented in separate pieces based on the concept that if you break something large, and therefore difficult or impossible to design, implement, and manage, down into its component parts and work on each part separately, that when you put them all back together they will somehow work well together as a complete system. This is a mechanistic approach, or what is known in science as a "Newtonian" approach, to systems that are neither machines nor the static, predictable environments that these traditional approaches treat them as.<br /><br />A large, complex system like the Federal Government is neither a machine nor a static, predictable environment, so traditional approaches just don't work well. For example, each new piece of legislation and each new regulation can't just be "plugged in" to the existing "machinery" of the current government without impacting other aspects of the government.<br />A graphic example of this, that we all have to deal with at least once a year, are the Federal Tax Code and the IRS regulations that try to "Provide America's taxpayers top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all" (IRS Mission Statement).<br /> How can the IRS effectively and efficiently carry out its mission when the Tax Code is a massive patchwork of laws that have been enacted as separate measures, often driven by political aims rather than the common good?<br /> How can a Senator or Representative gain sufficient understanding of this jumble to pass legislation that will optimize the entire system of taxes, including their impact on and interaction with all of the different factors and stakeholders, rather than just the small piece they are working on (even if we assume the best intentions on their part of working for the common good)?<br /> How can taxpayers possibly understand and comply with this mess, especially when it keeps changing all the time and makes little real sense to them even when they can figure out what actions they're supposed to take?<br /><br />So the government is not a machine; it is a complex, living, evolving system. In fact, any system involving people is by nature complex and constantly changing, since we are so driven by our personal beliefs, needs, feelings, relationships, and reactions to our environment. Trying to design, implement, and manage a transparent, open government for 300 million of us diverse, unpredictable humans is almost unimaginably complex. What we need for this is a proven way to work with complex living systems, what is often called a "Whole Systems Approach."<br /><br />A Whole Systems Approach considers all the factors and elements involved, including how they relate to each other, how they work together as a whole, what the system needs to develop, thrive, and evolve in its environment, and how the system impacts and interacts with its surrounding environment, including how the system will be able to respond and evolve as needs and the surrounding environment change.<br /><br />For the Transparency and Open Government Initiative this would involve using a whole systems approach throughout this initiative - brainstorming, designing, implementing, and managing the system. This whole systems approach should include:<br /><br /> Look at how the best ideas that emerge out of this effort can come together within the existing government system to collectively produce the desired outcomes of a transparent and open government, as well as the most beneficial impact on the other aspects of the government and the environment in which it operates - this country and the world. The goal is to create synergies that result in a system that is greater than the sum of its parts (these ideas and the elements of the government they involve) -- rather than the other way around, which is the usual result of a mechanistic approach to a complex system. This includes not just synergistic relationships within the Federal Government, but with key aspects of the environment in which it operates such as State and Local Governments, as well as with other current government initiatives such as Economic Recovery.<br /><br /> To address the complexity and uncertainty inherent in this system, a whole systems approach is first and foremost based on a set of principles. These principles guide and shape the whole systems process rather than prescribing a fixed recipe or methodology that details out each step of the process like mechanistic approaches do. What these whole systems principles are varies somewhat among whole systems practitioners and should be crafted collaboratively anyway as part of the initiative's participative process. But I can provide a couple of examples here to help you envision how they are different from other, more linear, mechanistic approaches.<br /> -- Design for Emergence - This is a concept from complexity science that addresses how to deal with the uncertainty involved with complex, rapidly changing systems. It basically means that you can't predict in advance everything that will happen within the system, so don't overdesign everything in the system up front. Instead, design just enough of the system to be able to simulate, prototype or pilot it, observe what happens, and then adjust the design based on your observations of what emerged from the system (thus the term, "design for emergence"). To deal with the complexity of the system, it can also involve implementing the system in stages with each stage adding additional complexity to the previous stages that are already operational and observing and changing the system based on what emerges when you add additional complexity.<br /> -- Design for Sustainability - This means you should expect to go through iterations of this process pretty much indefinitely. This is because not only will you need to make changes to the design based on your observations of the initial implementation, you will also need to keep making changes indefinitely to adapt to ongoing changes in the environment. Another consideration in designing for sustainability is to place a strong emphasis on transforming the underlying culture by embedding the new mindset and practices so deeply into the culture that the system will be sustainable through major changes such as a change of parties, personalities, or priorities in the White House.<br /><br /> Ideally, the whole system view should include the following major elements, how they relate to each other, how they relate to the existing government system, and how the whole thing works together as a whole system. Ideas already posted here are shown in (parens) as examples of each element. This big picture view will also enable us to identify gaps, overlaps, and conflicts between the ideas/elements.<br /> -- Strategy - What are the most important questions we need to address with this initiative such as, "What does 'open and transparent government' really mean? Why are we doing this? What are we trying to accomplish? What does success look like? What are the most important factors involved in achieving this success? <br />(examples: "Develop an overall adaptive, participative strategy for Transparency and Open Government"; "Require all agencies to submit a plan for open government")<br /> -- Culture (examples: "Ask Federal Agencies to Adopt the Core Principles for Public Engagement"; "Create a Government-wide Transparency, Collaboration, and Participation Culture")<br /> -- Leadership (examples: President Obama's ongoing leadership of this initiative, starting with his "Memorandum For The Heads Of Executive Departments And Agencies"; "Hold Agencies Accountable for Implementing the Open Government Directive")<br /> -- Communication (examples: "Promise USA - National Network of Citizen Conversation"; "Convene the American Public in National Discussions ...", "Use visual recording and mini animations to convey complex ideas") <br /> -- Processes - (examples: "72-Hour Mandatory Public Review Period on Major Spending Bills"; "Centralize petitions to Congress and the President")<br /> -- Organization - (example: "Integrate Participation and Collaboration into All Major Systems of Federal Agencies", "Invite Congress to work with the Administration on this as a government-wide, bi-partisan initiative")<br /> -- Technology (examples: "Online, visually interactive, one-stop-shop, federal budget website", "Digitize everything")<br /> -- Resources/Funding (example: "Fully fund participation and collaboration activities")<br /> -- External Relationships - (examples: "Encourage State and Local Governments to Become More Open and Inclusive", "Use 501c3 non-profit member and volunteer-based organizations and community-based initiatives as models/benchmarks for the Federal government")<br /> -- System Measurement & Improvement - (example: "Process for measuring, widely communicating the measurement results, and continuously improving the transparency and openness of the government")<br /><br /> Employ proven systems tools to do this. Some of the ideas already presented in this forum are examples of systems tools: widespread, diverse, coordinated participation; ongoing dialogue; weaving the ideas together into graphic maps or models; social networking, collaboration, and information gathering and dissemination technologies, and others. But there are other tools that would also be useful.<br /><br />To begin this Whole Systems process and to illustrate how it works, I took a cursory look at the top ideas posted here so far and visualized the system that would possibly result from integrating them. In doing so, I identified some areas where I felt the composite of these ideas needed strengthening in order to create a Whole System that could meet President Obama's objectives. As a result, I have added several new ideas as separate postings in this forum. They are meant to come together with the existing ideas to create a more effective Whole System. These have been posted already or will be soon.<br /> Develop an overall adaptive, participative strategy for Transparency and Open Government<br /> Create a government-wide culture of transparency, collaboration, and participation<br /> Invite Congress to partner with the Administration on this as a government-wide, bi-partisan initiative<br /> Use 501c3 non-profit member and volunteer-based organizations and community-based initiatives as models/benchmarks for the Federal government<br /> Process for measuring, widely communicating the measurement results, and continuously improving the transparency and openness of the government<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>One of the major challenges with large initiatives (such as this Transparency and Open Government initiative) and large organizations/institutions (such as the Federal Government) is the lack of integration, collaboration, and synergy that usually result from trying to design, implement, and manage anything this large and complex. A Whole Systems approach is a proven way to look at how the best ideas that emerge out of this effort can come together within the existing government system to collectively produce the desired outcomes of a transparent and open government, as well as the most beneficial impact on the other aspects of the government and the environment in which it operates - this country and the world. The goal is to create synergies that result in a system that is greater than the sum of its parts (these ideas plus the elements of the government they involve) -- rather than the other way around, which is the usual result of a traditional, mechanistic approach to a large, complex system like the Federal government.</div><br />	Arian Ward	46	48	2	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3117-4049

3125-4049	Invite Congress to partner with the Administration on this as a government-wide, bi-partisan initiative	2009-05-25 00:00:00	In reading President Obama's January 21st "Memorandum For The Heads Of Executive Departments And Agencies" that launched this Transparency and Open Government initiative, you will notice that the whole focus is on the Executive Branch of the Federal Government. This makes sense since the Constitution only gives the President formal management authority over this branch of the government. He can only influence the other branches through such means as court nominations, proposed legislative agendas and legislation, advocacy, and more informal interactions and relationships.<br /><br />Obviously, it's far easier to move ahead with an initiative over which the President has ultimate authority and can therefore assume the leadership role, which is a critical factor in the success of any large scale change. But to reach the goal of creating a transparent, open Federal Government, the Executive Branch can't do it alone. The role of the Legislative Branch - Congress, in enacting the legislation that the Executive Branch implements and manages, gives it an equally important stake in creating transparency, collaboration, and participation across the Federal Government.<br /><br />Recognizing this, a number of the ideas posted to this forum are aimed at Congress. A prime example is the idea with by far the most votes at this time, "Support a 72-Hour Mandatory Public Review Period on Major Spending Bills." You can't realistically plan to implement this idea without the full participation and backing of Congress, since they are the ones most impacted by it. Why would Congress support this idea if they weren't active participants in the design, implementation, and management of this new process?<br /><br />Besides this, Congress is the only branch of the Federal Government that provides ongoing, bi-partisan participation and representation in the government's activities. The Administration is naturally dominated by the party elected into the White House. Regardless of how impartial any President or Administration may try to be, they are human and subject to bias, just like the rest of us. So, in addition to inviting the participation of all Americans in this initiative through means such as this Open Government Dialogue, inviting Congress to participate would aid in designing and implementing a bi-partisan system that could be sustained across all the political changes the government undergoes every election. Otherwise, everything this initiative implements could be thrown out with the next change of Administration.<br /><br />Therefore, Congress should be invited to partner with the Administration in moving forward with all phases of this initiative!<br /><br />Note: The Supreme Court and the rest of the Federal Judicial System are, by definition and design, supposed to be removed from the partisan political process of governance and therefore tend to be less transparent and open than the other branches of government. There may be some opportunities for more transparency and openness in the judicial system. But these should probably be left for a later time, since the benefits of including them at this time would probably be outweighed by the increased complexity and scale involved in including them now. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The role of Congress in enacting the legislation that the Administration implements and manages, gives it an equally important stake in creating transparency, collaboration, and participation across the Federal Government.

3132-4049	Nurture Leadership Capacity (competency and character) 	2009-05-25 00:00:00	Please invest in the success of leaders in the public sector by providing technical assistance for their leadership development. Just like athletes, they need a practice field with coaching to make the organizational system changes required to make public participation a true reality. Many leaders hold the intention to be open, transparent and collaborative, but they do not possess the knowledge, skills and attitudes required. Research shows that clarity on strategic intent and a positive learning culture are essential. Studies also show that these elements are often missing in the public sector. What are the consequences? What do we know about what creates success?<br /><br />The National Research Council studied the effectiveness of public participation efforts in the environmental realm. The Council concluded that when done well, public participation improves the quality and legitimacy of a decision and builds the capacity of all involved to engage in the policy process. Yet the book's authors provide a cautionary note, "evidence shows that it is possible to conduct public participation processes that are counterproductive and that may be worse than not including the public at all." The Council reviewed the results to establish critical elements for success. According to the authors, "When government agencies engage in public participation, they should do so with:<br /><br />o Clarity of purpose<br />o A commitment to use the process to inform their actions<br />o Adequate funding and staff<br />o Appropriate timing in relation to decisions<br />o A focus on implementation<br />o A commitment to self-assessment and learning from experience."<br /><br />Leaders face an enormous paradox that must be managed. Public agencies are bureaucratic hierarchies with conflicting stakeholder interests. Yet finding answers to complex problems requires shared leadership dedicated to serving the common good - gathering those impacted by a decision and listening and learning with both internal and external stakeholders. Bridging between the organizational structure and an empowered microcosm is an art form, not a science. It requires skillful, intentional, courageous and ethical leaders with good judgment and the curiosity to host strategic learning conversations. <br /><br />Lastly, we suggest the government support a learning community for agencies - taking full advantage of social media tools. As Omega Point International, we initiated a Kansas + Colorado Learning Partnership with our clients at the state, county and city levels. Yet the effort is hampered by a lack of resources. Please find the resources to invest in these pioneers and others who have learned tools for thinking and acting in new ways and are committed to sharing what works and what doesn't.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Leaders in the Public Sector need to be given every opportunity for success, and then be held accountable for creating change resilient cultures that thrive on openness, transparency and collaboration.

3144-4049	Mandatory Exit Strategy	2009-05-25 00:00:00	My idea is to require any major or minor initiative or bill in congress to outline a minimum of two exit strategies. As any bill exits committee and enters open debate, it must articulate how its effects are intended to work and what mitigation strategies will be used to ensure it maintains its rightful purpose. Each bill will delineate a time frame for objective completion and address optimum as well as adverse scenarios. This initiative will also minimize deception and abuse of the system by outlining appropriate steps to take in these cases.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It is good business to plan ahead prior to taking action and to analyze each possible scenario before enacting a plan. Every prudent business decision ever made has assessed its assumptions, planned for contingencies, and implemented best practices in accordance with the plan. Failure is immediately addressed and offending items are eradicated according to plan without any further recourse or wasted time. Bills that are past often do not consider the long term repercussions or outline the original life-span or intention and can lead to drastically harmful consequences, leaving legislators little to no choice but to deal with the effects in a very inefficient manner. Consider the implications of this requirement in outlining how Social security would have been paid for in a decreasing population prior to passing, or what would the effective course of action have been in Iraq when WMD's were not found. How would this measure have affected the TARP program when righteous calls to legislators fell on deaf ears?<br /><br />This initiative requires lawmakers as well as laws to be held accountable to their words and actions in a way never before considered in representative government. It also clearly articulates the intentions of legislation in a format that is understandable to the American people. There will no longer be ambiguity in the effect of legislation due to abuse of language or complicated wording. It forces prudent and deliberate action on the behalf of the American people that is in the spirit of our founders. </div><br />	zauberer44	10	18	8	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3144-4049

Agencies' commitments to transparency vary widely. There is little sharing of best practices and virtually no Executive Branch oversight of the implementation of transparency policies. In order for the situation to improve, there must be one office designated to oversee these issues on a government-wide basis. Whether called the Office of the Chief Transparency Officer or given another title, that office should be granted the authority to issue implementing guidelines to make the Open Government Directive a reality and should have a leadership and coordinating role with respect to the other components of the government that are charged with transparency responsibilities, including the General Services Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (and its Office of Information Policy), the National Archives and Records Administration (and its Office of Government Information Services), and the agencies' Chief FOIA Officers.

3149-4049	Implement E-FOIA’s Public Index Requirement to Start Making Sense of the Government’s Information Holdings	2009-05-25 00:00:00	Transparency has been hindered by the inability of agencies to explain to the public what type of records they hold, such as by providing an index and description of major information systems, which is required by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), or through the Government Information Locator Systems (GILS) program. As a result, members of the public often do not know which agency has the information they need or how to obtain it. An approach that allows citizens to better identify and describe the type of records they are seeking and, in most cases, access them through an online or publicly available database without filing a FOIA request, would be a major step forward for transparency. <br /><br />Agencies should be required to develop descriptive indexes of their information holdings that are easy to understand and accessible to the public. To facilitate this process and provide leadership, the Administration should designate a responsible official in each agency to oversee an inventory of information holdings; set a schedule for completion of an inventory process; and direct the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General Services Administration (GSA) to develop a means for presenting indexes to the public.

3150-4049	Identify Disclosure Priorities Using FOIA Trends	2009-05-25 00:00:00	The Open Government Directive should establish a mechanism for setting information disclosure priorities. This process should be overseen by a responsible official within each agency, someone in a position to understand the broad scope of the agency's information holdings. Several complementary approaches to identifying disclosure priorities make sense:<br />• Agencies should first look at which records the public is already making an effort to obtain under the FOIA. Each agency maintains a log of the FOIA requests that it receives and some agencies already are using their logs to determine frequently requested categories of records. <br />• In addition, each agency should systematically identify groups of records that would be of significant current interest to the public by reviewing media and public affairs requests and key decisions or events involving the agency. Some agencies, such as the CIA and the State Department, have historical advisory boards that could assist with prioritization efforts and agencies could initiate a process to solicit public input. <br />• An interagency process overseen by the office tasked with transparency leadership should be convened to coordinate and exchange best practices and consideration should be given to employing a public advisory board or boards to assist with prioritization efforts. <br />• On a government-wide scale, the Office of Management and Budget should use interactive technologies, such as an online survey, to seek input from the public and federal employees on identifying priority information needs.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	National Security Archive	28	33	5	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3150-4049	
3151-4049	Require Agencies to Affirmatively Disclose Information to the Public, as Mandated by E-FOIA	2009-05-25 00:00:00	The Electronic Freedom of Information Act (E-FOIA) offers a starting point for affirmative and proactive government transparency efforts. The law requires agencies to make available online basic information about agency practices and policies and, most significantly, information requested or likely to be requested frequently under FOIA. <br /><br />Unfortunately, many agencies have not complied fully with E-FOIA, have interpreted the law too narrowly, or have been unwilling to go further than the minimum that the law requires. Effecting full compliance with both the letter and the spirit of E-FOIA across the federal government would go a long way towards achieving President Obama's vision of government transparency. Indeed, a true presumption of openness would presume that all non-Privacy Act FOIA requests are of interest to the public and would result in the posting online of virtually all records provided to the public in response to a FOIA request. <br /><br />The framework established in the E-FOIA Amendments is familiar to agencies and provides a useful starting point for the Obama administration to broaden existing policy and practice with regard to affirmative and proactive disclosure of government information. The Department of Justice Office of Information Policy should be tasked with initiating a program to educate agencies on their obligations and advise agencies on best practices and developing a schedule for agencies to meet milestones related to affirmative and proactive online posting of records. The General Services Administration or another appropriate agency should be directed to support agency efforts to make their electronic reading rooms more usable, including development of standardized metadata for use in this process. Agencies should be required to report publicly on a regular basis on their progress in meeting their milestones.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	National Security Archive	65	69	4	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3151-4049	
3152-4049	Use the Federal Record Act (and the Budget Process) to Implement Effective Record Retention Policies	2009-05-25 00:00:00	To ensure meaningful advances in information disclosure under the new directive, the Obama administration must address the ongoing problem of electronic recordkeeping. Across the federal government, agencies do not have adequate systems to store and retrieve electronic records, including e-mail communications, to ensure that these records are properly archived, preserved, searchable, and accessible for public disclosure. Without a standardized approach that mandates electronic preservation, rather than relying on individual agencies and even employees to preserve government records, the transparency that President Obama envisioned in his directive cannot be implemented fully. The White House should support legislation that would mandate appropriate electronic records management.<br /><br />The tens of billions of dollars of federal funds spent on information technology each year should include a portion dedicated to records lifecycle management, so we are not simply pushing costs down the road. The federal IT budget process should require new spending to include electronic records lifecycle considerations. <br /><br />Moreover, the administration should work to standardize the records retention process across the government. The National Research Council in its 2005 report on the National Archives and Records Administration's Electronic Records Archives' (ERA) long-term strategy recommended requiring "all newly acquired agency systems that produce permanent records to do the following: create those records in formats acceptable to NARA, include explicit metadata in their output, and use standardized mechanisms for transferring records to NARA." The Council's report even suggested that NARA should plan for the ERA to become the "off-site backup of agency records" in order to build in archival ingestion of records as close as possible to their creation.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	National Security Archive	43	44	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3152-4049

3157-4049	Public Schools 2.0: Public Schools as a service to the student and society. Open society vs Gangs.	2009-05-25 00:00:00	Our top-down educational system is holding us back. It was adopted during the industrial revolution as a means to increase conformity and educational standards. Unfortunately, government has been using these goals as reason for oppression. In many cases, constitutional rights are completely ignored in the name of "education." For example, public schools around the country have adopted school uniform policies which disallow them to express their individual views (even in protest) through their clothing. Some schools have gone as far as to prohibit demonstrations and button campaigns because they get in the way of education. We don't prohibit workers strikes just because they get in the way of production, why would we do the equivalent to students?<br /><br />Then there is the "my way or the high-way" disease of the current educational system. This is purely a power play on the part of the educators. It suppresses the students, and ultimately society, because it teaches them that critical thinking, and challenging informational sources is a social taboo. This is extremely harmful to democracy: a population afraid to stand up for their beliefs, afraid to challenge those who are in power, and believe everything that they are told. Public schools should not be used as a social filter, an oppressive force, or a tool for bureaucracy.<br /><br />The core problem is: our students are treated as a product of education. It's time to change this perception. We have been out of the industrial age for a long while; it is time our educational system does the same. Maybe education can become an open-source online system. Maybe it remains in the classroom but the methods change. In either case, the students should learn how to think for themselves, and should be allowed to have whatever social entity that they want. After all, they are the ones who define society in the future that we are preparing them for. Why should we be holding them back with our fears of change?<br /><br />Did I mention gangs? Sociologists define gangs as a deviance from social norms. Those who join gangs often do so because they reject either the means, or the ends of society. They feel that society is not fair to them, and they seek protection of their own beliefs. If students feel protected in our society, then they will accept it as their own. Thus, gangs become a thing of the past. Loosen the belt on society and it flourishes and everyone wants to be a part.<br /><br />P.S. Don't dump this idea just because you disagree with a small detail. If you support the general ideology, bump it up and we can work out the details through democracy.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>We all know that education is a key to success. If we get it right, we can fix a lot of problems.</div><br />	stueverjc	13	23	10	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3157-4049	
3161-4049	End Imperial Presidency	2009-05-25 00:00:00	[UPDATE 5/29: In the spirit of collaborative decision making, this lengthy proposal should be viewed as a theme, and alterations to details suggested. The most commonly proposed alteration suggested so far is eliminating the proposal to eliminate the Senate, and I am leaning toward doing so. Other changes can be proposed too.]<br /><br />Leave the White House less imperial than you found it. Prosecute Bush, Cheney, and their top officials in order to deter in the future the crimes of aggressive war, misleading congress, defrauding congress, misspending funds, war crimes, murder, warrantless spying, torture, domestic propaganda, violations of the Hatch Act and the Voting Rights Act, obstruction of justice, misprision of felony, retaliating against whistleblowers, etc. Restore to Congress the power to legislate, the power to begin and end wars, the power to raise and spend money, the power to approve or reject treaties and appointments, and the power to oversee the functioning of the federal government including through the power of impeachment and the power of inherent contempt. That means no more signing statements rewriting laws, and instead support for legislation that would criminalize such behavior. And it means similar action on each of the other offenses. <br /><br />We, the people, must:<br /><br />Demand that Congress ban the use of funds for any activities created in violation of the law by presidential signing statements.<br /><br />Amend the Constitution to clearly ban the use of presidential pardons to pardon crimes authorized by the president.<br /><br />Amend the War Powers Act and the Constition to include the requirement that Congressional authorizations of war include time limits of no more than 12 months, after which Congress must vote again to extend the war or end it, to disallow the unconstitutional initiation of wars without Congressional approval, and to make the law enforceable.<br /><br />Make war profiteering by any war maker a major felony. This would apply to any employee of the federal government or anyone who had within the past decade been an employee of the federal government.<br /><br />Legislate a requirement that, in any war, the military aged children and grandchildren of the president, the vice president, all cabinet officials, and all Congress members serve on the front lines in the most dangerous combat positions -- no exceptions, no exemptions.<br /><br />Prohibit the use of mercenaries or any armed contractors, as well as the use of any military force on American soil except when directly engaged in defensive war against a foreign nation.<br /><br />Repeal the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, the Military Commissions Act of 2006, the 2008 FISA Amendments Act, the Protect America Act, the original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and the PATRIOT Act.<br /><br />Ban secret budgets, secret laws, and secret agencies.<br /><br />Change the Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster.<br /><br />Amend the Constitution to eliminate the Senate. [UPDATE: Let's clarify that you can support this general proposal without taking a position on this item, which is new to many people. Explanation posted below.*]<br /><br />End all rendition, as distinct from extradition.<br /><br />Amend the Constitution to make the ban on ex-post-facto laws include any laws that would retroactively grant immunity for crimes.<br /><br />Amend the Constitution to bar the vice president from exercising executive power.<br /><br />Amend the Constitution to clarify the congressional power of inherent contempt.<br /><br />Amend the Constitution to include the right to vote and to have one's vote counted publicly at the polling place.<br /><br />Give Washington, D.C., full voting representation in Congress.<br /><br />Amend the Constitution to ban private financing of campaigns, create public financing, and provide free air time to candidates.<br /><br />Sign and ratify the Rome treaty to join the International Criminal Court.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />OPTIONAL PART 2 OF THIS PROPOSAL - Drafted and withheld at first, posted May 29th in response to useful comments from ttahiti and many others posted below.<br /><br />Release more evidence, and support organizations suing in court for the release of evidence. <br /><br />Ask Congress to update and reissue the subpoenas that were refused during the 110th Congress, and to enforce them through inherent contempt. <br /><br />Support media reform and independent media outlets. Break up the monopolies. Invest in public media, including an E-Span election network to provide free substantive election coverage.<br /><br />Advance a long-term vision in which the corrupting influences of money, media, and party are restrained, and our rights are restored, enforced, and expanded, including the right to vote and to have our votes counted publicly and locally, equal rights for all, environmental rights, the right to education and healthcare, worker rights, the right to basic welfare, freedom of press, freedom from war lies, and the right to know your rights. <br /><br />Push for approval, ratification, and enforcement of international human rights treaties. Build toward Constitutional amendments or a convention with a plan to establish the right to know the laws and to have them applied equally, a ban on signing statements, whistleblowers protected, inherent contempt established, corporations stripped of human rights, monopolies restricted, clean campaign money and free media created, the power of parties reduced, nonpartisan (not bipartisan) redistricting, limiting election seasons, no more electoral college, a bigger House with no Senate, the right to be represented, no appointing of senators, limiting terms for judges, requiring a balanced budget, limiting bills to single topics and requiring clarity, allowing legislation by public initiative, allowing recall elections, creating citizen assemblies, and developing a fourth (people's) branch of government.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />*Explanation of proposal to eliminate the Senate: Many people have asked me why in the world we would eliminate the Senate, as if the idea were completely new. It is not originial to me, and given the efforts that activists spend every year trying to pass legislation that's bad enough for the House but not bad enough for the Senate, I'm surprised it's new to anyone. The House tried to end slavery 8 times. The role of the Senate was intended to be and has been the blocking of popular proposals from the House. The House is long overdue for being enlarged, not to mention reformed, but the Senate serves no purpose that cannot be better served by the House alone. On every issue, the House is closer to majority opinion than the Senate is. The Senate is not just more corrupted by money. It also over-represents small states, so that one senator represents a half million people but another has to represent 17 million people -- neither task being remotely possible. This is also why small states draw a disproportionate share of public services. The only defense of the Senate is, in fact, that it represents the particular interests of small states, and yet while senators are much more supportive than House members of illegal spying, campaign bribery, war profiteering, union busting, torture, environmental destruction, private health insurance, and super-militarism, the same cannot be said of the residents of small states as compared to the residents of large states. Senators are also more supportive than House members of measures that strip state governments of power. Again, you don't need to support the elimination of the Senate to back this proposal and vote it up, but I hope to have answered the bewildered questions and possibly addressed the proposals to enlarge the Senate. Let's end it, not mend it.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Empires end and they can end happily by voluntarily reforming, or they can end miserably by refusing to. </div><br />	david	339	437	98	69	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3161-4049

3165-4049	Collaborative processes Ned to Measure Up to Democratic Principles	2009-05-25 00:00:00	Collaborative processes are adjuncts to traditional democratic processes. As such, they have to measure up to principles of good democratic practice. One of the core principles by which a collaborative process will be measured is the extent to which it is inclusive and representative of the public and key stakeholder interests. If it fails to be inclusive and representative, the outcomes of the process will likely not be viewed as legitimate. <br /><br />In setting up laws or procedures to ensure that open government processes mechanisms are effective and accountable, here are some questions that need to be given careful consideration:<br /><br />•Who gets to participate? How are they chosen? ¬ Do there need to be specifications about how representative or inclusive they are? <br /><br />•What authorities do participants have? Are they advisory or decision-making? <br /> <br />•Who has rights to be involved, to influence, to be heard, and to challenge the exercise of power? <br /><br />•What access do participants have to resources - time, space, information, data, and skills? <br /><br />•What procedures, if any, guide how they operate?<br /><br />•Who are the sponsors and participants accountable to? <br /><br />•How and when does the collaborative process need to be linked to traditional democratic mechanisms? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	chris	15	15	0	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3165-4049	
3166-4049	Decision Process Transparency	2009-05-25 00:00:00	Although many of the posts in this category are concerned with making all government data and communications available to the public, I would like to address a different transparency concept: process transparency.<br /><br />In this form of transparency, there is government openness regarding how decisions will be made. This includes making public and publicizing timetables, process road maps, decision criteria, roles/participants in each step of the process, and opportunities for participation, as well as how that participation will inform the decision process. Ideally, a first step in a decision process would allow the public and interest groups to comment on the decision process itself.<br /><br />Though this sounds relatively easy, process transparency faces multiple institutional/cultural obstacles. Process transparency requires support from the highest levels of agency leadership and elected officials to avoid backroom deal-making and last-minute power plays (at least without publicly updating the decision road map).<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Being clear and upfront about how decisions will be made is important in building trust and creating an equal footing for participation. It also fosters greater accountability for decisions that are made.</div><br />	bidwell2	19	20	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3166-4049

3177-4049	Healthcare Electronic Medical Records Costs	2009-05-25 00:00:00	Before designing any new healthcare administration, passing it and signing it into law, force EMR companies to bid and display their wares. I co-own and run some medical practices in the state of Virginia, and I am appalled by what I am hearing from official Washington and the media about what quality, secure and reliable EMR systems will costs. I have heard costs ranging from 40,000.00 per medical office up to 20 million dollars for hospitals. <br /><br />I can tell you from experience that some of these EMR companies are taking advantage of physicians ignorance. I have had some come in my office and tell me that to set up a "state of the art" system" would cost us 50k. I told them to hit the door. We purchased a system for our offices for under 12k and that includes outfiting 2 offices with computers as well as the software. <br /><br />There are EMR companies that are owned and run by physicians. The biggest complaint other than the outrageous costs being thrwon around, is that most of the EMR software is written by engineers that think like engineers. So when I doctor goes to use it, it actually decreases his efficiency as he struggles to write a simple note, or prescription. I've found that the more expensive the system, the more complex it is and the bigger waste of money it is. <br /><br />Talk to all EMR vendors, large and small. Don't discount the small guys just because they don't have slick websites and glossy brochures. Make sure the Docs on whatever advisory panel you have, are not on the take either. Most doctors are honest hardworking people, but most are not great business people. So they will buy whatever some silver tongued salesman has to sell without doing their due diligence.<br /><br />It should NOT cost the average practice 40k to have a great system. It should NOT cost a hospital 20 million dollars to upgrade to EMR. (For 20 million dollare one could build a state of the art cardiology wing or a cancer research institue that would make NASA jealous!!)<br /><br /> Again, if you don't have anyone that can tell you the flat footed truth, email me back I'd be glad to come in and help make sure that Physicians and Hospitals and ultimately the patients and taxpayers don't get screwed!!!!<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	ejerod	40	40	0	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3177-4049	
3179-4049	Application of Transformative Facilitation to Assist Public Dialogue	2009-05-25 00:00:00	One should guarantee that public engagement processes will be transparent, consensual, and inclusive through the application of private, non-judgmental, non-coercive transformative facilitation. In facilitation, the duality of right versus wrong does not have to exist. There can instead be a continuum of "rightness," predicated on a participant's knowledge and perception of possible outcomes. This is one of the focal points of Transformative Facilitation. People must learn to listen to one another's ideas, not as points of debate but as different and valid experiences in a collective reality, in order to have new experiences and broaden their understanding. Then they can fully participate in a search for common ground. After all, society evolves not by shouting each other down, but by the unique capacity of unique, individual human beings to comprehend each other. The role of a facilitator using Transformative Facilitation is to help people do this in a group setting.<br /> <br />At the same time, through the application of appropriate transformative facilitation tools, participants are encouraged to accept a challenge to their ideas in the spirit of learning, rather than as an invitation to combat. The greatest triumphs in science and/or policy-setting for example are not, after all, triumphs of facts but rather triumphs of new ways of seeing, of thinking, of perceiving, and of asking questions. In this way participants can act in the spirit of "since I do not know for sure who is more right than whom, I must in fairness accept that everyone is right from his or her own point of view, and each point of view is different -- not wrong, only different -- regardless of what the discussion is about." Through appropriately facilitated communication, our many individual perceptions are coordinated and integrated into a collective vision of reality. <br /> <br />Likewise, transformative facilitation techniques focus on the fact that it is extremely important in human interactions to keep each person's dignity, which means "I will protect your dignity so you can protect mine." Dignity's emotional foundation rests on the perceived ability to make choices, which in turn provides a sense of hope. For example, although I cannot convince you that you are wrong without somehow attacking your dignity, I can give you new data, which raises the value of your making a new decision based on new information. In this way, I can be patient while maintaining your dignity intact. Remove the sense of choice that has to do with one's determination of one's own destiny and you remove hope as well, and human dignity withers.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The transformative facilitation approach is aimed at empowering the individual while engendering a collective experience of resolving shared problems according to the group's self-defined values. With common ground established, issues are more readily resolved and change more easily organized and implemented. Transformative facilitation promotes a sense of accomplishment and belonging through shared learning and dialogue in a process of growing self-realization, self-definition, and self-determination. Through appropriately facilitated communication, the many individual perceptions are then coordinated and integrated into a collective vision.</div><br />	Warren Flint	19	20	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3179-4049

3183-4049	Tax simplification	2009-05-25 00:00:00	There are nearly 300 million Americans and almost half pay little or no income taxes at the Federal level.<br /><br />Go to a hybrid graduated flat tax.

Eliminate employee payroll taxes, capital gains taxes and the like and just use the flat rate schedule. IT will streamline government, save taxpayers billions in fees they pay to companies like Jackson Hewitt, that more often than not take advantage of people who don't know any better and most of all it would increase government revenues so we can pay off the debt.<br /><br />Allow companies a lower tax rate ONLY if they use the tax break to creat more jobs. The fallacy with trickle down economics is that when the wealthy get tax breaks, they don't necessarily use the windfall to reinvest and grow their businesses. Some reinvest in larger yachts and private jets, which may be great for those two industries but sucks for the rest of America.

3184-4049	Seeking Resiliency in Sustainable Community Development	2009-05-25 00:00:00	In September 2009 I will be presenting a training session at the International Association of Public Participation (IAP2) meeting in San Diego, CA. The focus of this session is to discuss several different tools in the facilitation and resolving of conflict for stakeholders (citizens) interested in sustainable community development that highlights efforts at seeking resiliency in community development. Tools like pattern mapping and spiraling capitals evaluation will be demonstrated with regards to their application toward building community capacity in meeting sustainability goals, in the context of the Dauphin Island (AL) community development work (http://www.eeeee.net/dauphin_island/dauphinisland.htm). These are the kinds of cutting-edge and emerging techniques that should be employed by groups promoting open government dialogue with the public.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Warren Flint	15	16	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3184-4049	
3185-4049	Standards for web forms / API for online communications	2009-05-25 00:00:00	In place of email addresses, legislators and government agencies increasingly rely upon a patch work of web-forms to handle their incoming online communications. In some cases these forms are extremely complicated, not fully accessible, and they can be a deterrent to citizens seeking to make their views on a subject heard.<br /><br />Create standards for web forms as government communication gateways and implement a standardized API to improve the overall online communications process.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>A standard communications API could have benefits for government, advocates and citizens. If executed well, such a measure could (1) provide an element of authenticity and origin to online communications, (2) aid in categorization of communications for staff, (3) create a fully accessible communication solution (currently some CAPTCHAs on government forms have no alternative for visually impaired), (4) provide an open ended way for citizens with to create organized petitions to their government without resorting to costly service providers or unscrupulous tactics.</div><br />	web	18	20	2	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3185-4049	
3187-4049	Elimination/Delay/Investigation of Pay-for-Performance Personnel Systems	2009-05-25 00:00:00	Recently eight US lawmakers requested the Office of Management and Budget<br />suspend implementation of all federal pay-for-performance systems pending a<br />review. The attached link is a copy of the request. (http://www.govexec.com/pdfs/040709ar2.pdf) Interestingly in the<br />letter, the request states that "This month the Department of Defense froze<br />implementation of two pay for performance systems, the National Security<br />Personnel System (NSPS) and the Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel<br />System (DCIPS), in order to conduct a thorough review of these systems." A three panel team has been appointed to investigate pay-for-performance systems, but their investigative results will be presented too late to stop some additional implementation of these pay-for-performance systems. <br /><br />Contrary to this Congressional request, several agencies are continuing to implement pay-for-performance systems (the intelligence community is continuing with implementation). In their haste, Federal employees may lose some abilities to operate in a fair and open Government.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>There are significant questions about whether pay-for-performance personnel systems meet their objectives and operate in a fair and transparent way. Questions concerning Federal career progression, discrimination, use of the system as a cost control measure, inconsistent independant arbitration of employee performance (favoritism and cronyism), and Federal employee morale are all open for discussion. <br /><br /><br /><br />These pay-for-performance systems are being hastily implemented with no regard for investigation of these questions. </div><br />	Transparency	9	11	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3187-4049

3190-4049	Ideas for Improving Transparency, Participation, and Collaboration in the Rulemaking Process	2009-05-25 00:00:00	1. To increase transparency, participation, and collaboration in the rulemaking process start telling the truth, the whole truth, about rulemaking on the government's Regulations.gov website. The site, initiated during the Bush Administration, was a useful but limited step forward in making the rulemaking process more transparent and encouraging participation. The site incorrectly gives the impression that THE opportunity for people's chance to participate is during the public comment period after the publication of an NPRM. Actually, sophisticated players in the process (e.g. lobbyists and large campaign contributors) have long taken advantage of opportunities to influence rulemaking decisions before an NPRM is published. Under the Obama Administration shouldn't average citizens be provided with the information they need to participate early in the process -- just like lobbyists and big campaign contributors?<br /><br />2. Make it easier to stay in touch with the status of rules under development. Encourage/require agencies to open dockets much earlier in the rulemaking process. Can dockets be augmented beyond just including documents necessary to legally support the rulemaking? Could information that would help the public understand and participate in the rulemaking such as press releases or Regulatory Agenda entries also be included? Alternatively, or in addition, let people sign up for notifications from Regulations.gov as soon as a rulemaking is added to a Regulatory Agenda or Action Initiation List. If operating a list serve for each rulemaking is too expensive, explore using an e-mail system with a dedicated box or boxes for subscribing to updates on particular rulemakings.<br /><br />3. Improve and make broader use of existing tools such as Action Initiation Lists and Regulatory Agendas for informing people about regulations under development. Expand on EPA's innovative Action Initiation List which it has been posting on Regulations.gov since April 2008 to make its rulemaking more transparent (http://www.regulations.gov/fdmspublic/component/main?main=DocketDetail&d;=EPA-HQ-OA-2008-0265). This list includes information about the Regulatory Agenda level actions recently approved for development by Agency management. It provides the title, abstract, contact person, projected publication timeframe, and Regulatory Identifier Number (RIN). EPA updates this list every month. If EPA leadership, which frequently was out of step with public opinion on the environment during the Bush Administration could be this transparent, what about matching, or topping the old level of transparency by spreading the Action Initiation List innovation to other agencies? <br /><br />For citizens to participate effectively and efficiently early in the rulemaking process it is imperative that they have timely information. Monthly Action Initiation List updates are far timelier than semiannual Regulatory Agenda updates. And the disparity in timeliness is made greater because the monthly AIL updates are posted within a few days of when the information is developed while it is generally takes GSA and OMB two to three months to clear and post Regulatory Agenda data.<br /><br />4. To increase participation and collaboration, if an agency thinks they would benefit from a particular type of expertise that they don't have in-house, as part of the initial or at least an early notification about the rulemaking, invite people with that expertise to volunteer to be individually contacted (so FACA requirements wouldn't be tripped) to get their input on specialized matters.<br /><br />5. Start routinely providing more information about plans for stakeholder involvement during the rulemaking process. For example there could be a section in each entry in the Regulatory Plan specifically addressing planned stakeholder involvement. There also could be an optional section on plans for stakeholder involvement in Regulatory Agenda entries.<br /> <br />6. Currently the government provides easily accessible information in the Regulatory Agenda for about half of the rules under development. Somewhere (one or more of Regulations.gov; http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/regulatory_affairs/default/; or Reginfo.gov), start providing some information and links about the other half that are not required to be in the Agenda. These actions are: <br />(1) Regulations or rules issued in accordance with the formal rulemaking<br />provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556, 557;<br />(2) Regulations or rules that pertain to a military or foreign affairs function<br />of the United States, other than procurement regulations and regulations<br />involving the import or export of non-defense articles and services;<br />(3) Regulations or rules that are limited to agency organization, management,<br />or personnel matters; <br />(4) Any other category of regulations exempted by the Administrator of OIRA; and <br />(5) Rules of particular applicability<br />(6) Regulatory Agenda level rules more than eleven or twelve months from proposal could be omitted (and OIRA directors have been encouraging agencies not to include them. Actually, the practice of not telling the public about these items in the Agenda should be ended immediately.)<br /><br />7. Modify the Regulatory Agenda to encourage timelier, more effective participation in rulemaking. Until 1995 there was no "Long Term" category for Agenda entries that were more than a year away from publication - if a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was the next publication the action appeared in the proposed rules section; if a final rulemaking was the next action to be published it appeared in the final rules section. Part of the political debate in Washington at the time centered on whether the Clinton Administration was doing too much rulemaking and there was a lot of throwing around of the number of rulemakings in the Regulatory Agenda in speeches and articles. To make it appear that there was less rulemaking, a new category "Long Term Actions" was created and it was lumped with "Completed Actions" in statistics on the number of rulemakings underway. This had the effect of greatly reducing the apparent number of actions under development. <br /><br />An unfortunate result of the existence of the Long Term category is that it can influence people to hold off getting involved until the rulemaking is no longer in the Long Term category. Unfortunately if someone holds off from getting in touch with the contact person until a rule appears in the Proposed Rule stage in the Regulatory Agenda and it were then only five or six months from proposal it is very likely that they would be told that they were too late to get involved during the pre-proposal phase. The last steps of the process prior to proposal (Final agency clearance prior to OMB review, then OMB review, and then clearance of the signature package) would very likely have already started and external, non-federal input at this point in the process generally would not be welcomed. <br /><br />Reverting to the pre-1995 categorization of rulemaking stages for the standard presentation of Regulatory Agenda information would simplify the Agenda and reduce the possibility that people would postpone getting involved. And if we added an option on Reginfo.gov for chronological sorting of entries by their upcoming Federal Register publication dates we would get a much richer, more useful chronolgical sort than is provided in the current Long Term category. Reducing the number of stages by one would have the additional advantage of reducing the number of pages in the Agenda published in the Federal Register and in the Agendas downloaded and printed from GPOAccess.gov and Regulations.gov by about 1% providing modest savings in public and private printing and waste disposal costs.<br /><br />Bush's OIRA directors discouraged agencies from including in the Agenda actions under development that were at least twelve months away from proposal and since the Agenda has usually been published a month or two late they effectively were discouraging agencies from including information on actions that were at least ten or eleven months from publication. Here's what they'd say in their memoranda to Regulatory Policy Officers and Managing and Executive Directors:<br /><br />"Unless your agency realistically intends to take action in the next twelve months, you can remove these items from the Agenda."<br /><br />Remedying this situation is totally within the power of the director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at OMB. Will Director Sunstein encourage agencies to "hide the ball" as his predecessors did, or will he instruct agencies to include all of the regulations they are working on even if they are more than ten or eleven or twelve months from publication?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Rulemaking broadly defined is a fundamental tool of government. The Federal rulemaking process which evolved over the last century is not well understood by the citizens who are so hugely affected by it. Improving participation, transparency, and collaboration in rulemaking will result in a society with more effective, more efficient governance and which is more successful in achieving its objectives (or so the theory goes.) Transparency, Participation, and Collaboration are closely related. Unless people know what the government is doing (transparency) how could they have any chance of consciously participating or collaborating in it. The ideas presented above could be split up among the Transparency, Participation, Collaboration, and Legal and Policy Challenges sections.

3191-4049	Remove Marijuana from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act	2009-05-25 00:00:00	Dear Mr. President,<br /><br />Please direct the DEA to remove marijuana from Schedule I and correctly classify it under the definitions that the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) provides. You said in your press conference (after you released the ban on federal funds for stem-cell research) that you believed that science should dictate policy not politics and I respectfully request that you follow through with this pledge even on something so politically toxic as marijuana.<br /><br />Schedule I of the CSA specifically states that in order to be placed in this schedule I that the substance in question must have "no accepted medical use for treatment in the United States." Well... as of 1996 there are states that have accepted the medicinal uses of marijuana for treatment. Currently there are 13 states that have ACCEPTED the medical use for treatment therefore the current scheduling goes against the definition that was put into place.<br /><br />In 1970, when the CSA was established there were NO accepted uses for treatment in the US, so the initial scheduling was correct. In 1988, when Administrative Law Judge Francis Young ruled that the DEA was required to reclassify marijuana there again were no states that had accepted the use for treatment and therefore the DEA had due cause to ignore the recommendation. But after California ACCEPTED the medical use for treatment in 1996 the Scheduel I classification became incorrect soley based on the definition.<br /><br />Why does the Federal Government currently provide Medical Marijuana to 4 citizens of the United States for treatment of their illnesses while upholding the classification under "no medical use for treatment"? Isn't this a little hypocritical???<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Please understand that this is not a call to legalize marijuana for recreational use (although that is a debate that should be had), but simply a call to recognize the laws that are written and to follow those laws based on current science and medical expertise. In no way should the Federal Governemt decide what medical treatment is best for a person, this is something that should be decided on between the doctor and the patient. With the way things currently stand, citizens in 13 states are currently at risk of Federal prosecution for possessing a "drug" that their doctor recommended. Why should we continue to treat these suffering people as criminals? </div><br />	DarthNole	301	340	39	28	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3191-4049	
3192-4049	engaging young Americans	2009-05-25 00:00:00	Young Americans are very eager to participate in democracy, as shown by their rapidly rising voter turnout rates and their high volunteering rates. By participating, they gain skills, habits, and values that last a lifetime--according to rigorous longitudinal research. They add important insights to any public discussion that involves youth or the long-term future of the country. Research shows that certain civic opportunities have substantial positive effects on their participation. These opportunities include moderated discussions of current events in school; high-quality community service projects with a dimension of research and planning; youth production of news media; and youth service on boards and committees. <br /><br />Unfortunately, providing civic opportunities for youth is a very low public priority. Civic education is hardly mentioned in No Child Left Behind. None of the opportunities mentioned above are encouraged by "high stakes" tests. The Department of Education does not fund research into civic education, and hardly funds any programs. There are good service opportunities funded by the federal Corporation for National and Community Service, but they are unconnected to other federal initiatives, such as the White House Office of Public Engagement.<br /><br />One of the results of this low level of support is extreme inequality in civic opportunities. Poor children, children in stressed schools, and children who are academically "at risk" rarely receive civic opportunities that are common in high-performing suburban schools. Unless we address this problem, we will miss the voice of low-income kids in any public process.<br /><br />The White House Office should work closely with the US Department of Education, the Corporation for National and Community Service, and other federal programs (e.gh., YouthBuild in HUD) to create an integrated and well supported structure for engaging a representative sample of young people in public deliberations about social issues.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Young Americans have a lot to offer to public discussions and benefit from participating. But their level of engagement is very unequal. Unless we build support for less advantaged youth, their voice will be overlooked.</div><br />	peter.levine	58	59	1	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3192-4049	
3193-4049	switch from transparency, collaboration, and participation to "work"	2009-05-25 00:00:00	In launching the Office of Public Engagement, the President said, "This office will seek to engage as many Americans as possible in the difficult work of changing this country, through meetings and conversations with groups and individuals held in Washington and across the country."<br /><br />The key word is "work." The Administration has an opportunity to redefine citizens as people who work on public problems; the government is an institution that helps them do that. The Administration can thereby revive the New Deal's conception of citizenship in our time of economic crisis. <br /><br />Rhetoric of "public work" will be much more powerful and resonant than language about "transparency, participation, and collaboration." The OPE has promised to "allow ordinary Americans to offer their stories and ideas regarding issues that concern them and share their views on important topics such as health care, energy and education." But I am skeptical that people (including me) are motivated to discuss issues--or are adequately informed about issues--if their only opportunity is to "offer stories" and "share views." Work is motivating and educational. It can draw a broad cross-section of Americans, whereas only specialists usually want to provide opinions and ideas.<br /><br />The President has signed the Kennedy Serve America Act, which will triple the size of AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps' members work on public problems. But it remains to be seen whether they will gain serious responsibilities so that they can develop skills of analysis, leadership and deliberation. A great opportunity is to enlist them in organizing and facilitating public conversations about policy. That would require coordination between the White House Office of Public Engagement and the Corporation for National and Community Service.<br /><br />The President has signed legislation to spend more than $200 billion in stimulus funds in areas like health care, infrastructure, and energy. That money will pay the salaries of public and private sector workers. They need to be treated as "active citizens" and invited to participate in discussions of policies and public priorities so that they can combine their labor with civic participation.<br /><br />The imminent retirement of roughly one million federal employees offers an opportunity to rethink public service so that jobs in the public sector become more rewarding and creativeâ&euro;&rdquo;to flatten hierarchies and promote collaboration, including partnerships between the government and community groups. <br /><br />Last summer, candidate Obama said, "I will ask for your service and your active citizenship when I am President of the United States. This will not be a call issued in one speech or one programâ&euro;&rdquo;-this will be a central cause of my presidency." Active citizenship includes expressing your views about issues, but it also requires service and work. That combination is essential.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The rhetorical framing that the Office is using will leave out a lot of Americans and will fail to capitalize on civic opportunities provided by the economic recovery.</div><br />	peter.levine	33	34	1	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3193-4049	
3194-4049	The administration should curb new exemptions from FOIA	2009-05-25 00:00:00	According to government agencies themselves, every year federal departments and agencies cite roughly 140 statutes to deny thousands of requests for information; our coalition (the Sunshine in Government Initiative) estimates that more than 240 are on the books. The agencies themselves are often the originators of these new legislative loopholes.<br /><br />Recommendation: Any new statutory exemptions proposed or supported by the Obama administration should be limited in scope and life and include oversight. The Obama administration should prohibit agencies from proposing new Exemption 3 statutes unless agencies determine that:<br /><br />1. Existing statutory protections and exemptions within FOIA are not adequate<br />2. The interest in withholding is specific and articulated<br />3. The interest in withholding clearly is greater than the public interest in disclosure<br />4. The exemption is publicly disclosed at the time it is proposed<br /><br />Further, any new proposals that meet the above criteria should be crafted narrowly to limit harm to the free flow of information. Specifically, each new proposal under Exemption 3 should:<br /><br />1. Clearly state its purpose and explain why the existing exemptions are inadequate<br />2. Be narrowly drafted so as not to exceed the specific non-disclosure needs compelling the exemption<br />3. Provide for public reporting that measures the efficacy of the exemption in achieving its stated goals<br />4. Offers alternative and equivalent means of public oversight<br />5. Have a built-in sunset provision<br />6. Clearly state in the text of the statute that the proposal is not intended to inhibit whistle blowing<br />7. Ensure any penalties for improper decisions in carrying out the statute are themselves balanced and without favor to withholding or disclosure<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Each new duplicative or unnecessarily broad FOIA carve-out tucked inconspicuously into a new statute sends a harmful and inaccurate message that every piece of legislation should include a blanket confidentiality provision. Some are duplicative of existing exemptions. They are never reviewed formally to determine if they are still needed or used properly. Most stay on the books forever once enacted.<br /><br />Too often Congress writes these provisions into law without adequate public debate or even review by the congressional committees experienced with FOIA. While Congress should formally refer all such provisions to congressional committees overseeing FOIA for review, the new administration can and should take proactive steps to prevent further erosions of our democratic process.<br /></div><br />	Sunshine in Government Initiative	56	59	3	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3194-4049

3196-4049	Protecting Privacy	2009-05-25 00:00:00	To ensure civic participation, privacy should be a top concern. Consumers expect the privacy and security of their data. And the government should not violate federal privacy, data security and wiretap laws well as corresponding rules applicable to government agencies. Numerous federal and state laws require government to maintain both the confidentiality and the protection of certain data, so IT solutions must be "government ready" by these criteria. Ensuring the privacy and security of data will increase consumer confidence and trust in the way data is handled by government and non-government actors alike. We cannot gamble public trust on IT solutions that have an open door to bad actors or that have unnecessary risks that would lead to even lower levels of civic engagement.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Consumers expect the privacy and security of their data.</div><br />	rskoglund	56	57	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3196-4049	
3197-4049	combine deliberation and service on Martin Luther King Day (and other holidays)	2009-05-25 00:00:00	The Presidential Transition Team did a great job encouraging community service as a way of marking Martin Luther King Day. They realized that good service involves discussion, planning, and reflection--not just action. To encourage reflection, they posted an online toolkit for people who wanted to facilitate discussions after their local MLK Day Service activity. But everything was very rushed before the Inauguration. The toolkit went online just a couple of days before Martin Luther King Day and has since disappeared. I don't think it was used much.<br /><br />Next year, there could be serious effort to encourage public discussions of issues, not only on King Day, but also on Presidents' Day, Memorial Day, Earth Day, Cesar Chavez Day, and other formal or informal national holidays. That effort could involve neutral discussion guides and a site where groups could log and share their conclusions.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Voluntary service on national holidays is common and could be a great spur to public deliberation.</div><br />	peter.levine	21	24	3	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3197-4049

Such Democrats unnecessarily tie their left hand behind their backs. I urge people to consider boycotting the friends of those conservatives in congress in order to force them to sit up and take notice and capitulate to our demands. In our country money appears an important factor in getting action done. We need to go on a purchasing strike against the friends of regressives in order to force them to cooperate with us. It appears peaceful and legal in an atmosphere of legalized bribery in congress. We need to take back control over our purchases and how the profits get spent especially how they get used for legalized bribery in congress. We indirectly fund conservatives in congress through our purchases. We need to set conditions for our purchases through targeted boycotts. <br /><br />If you don't like a particular TV program, you call their sponsors and tell them you will boycott them until the program either goes off the air or changes to your liking.

3199-4049	Back to Work	2009-05-25 00:00:00	Same as many U S citizens, I expect that the government's economic 'Recovery' programs will return our employer industries to the levels that prevailed before the nation was gripped by massive unemployment. I also expect that hiring trends will be gradual and extend across time.<br /><br />Granted that the unemployed will be offered jobs. Former employees will likely be recalled early. Then, new hires will come from the experienced, the sufficiently skilled, and otherwise acceptably qualified workers. <br /><br />Meanwhile, throughout the country, hundreds of thousands of adolescents to young adults are passing through 9th to 12th grades, and many 12th graders and dropouts have matured into men and women who are either heading for college or looking for a paying job in order to marry and 'make a living' for a planned family.<br /><br />What is 'government,' national to local, in the context of the federal 'Recovery' initiative doing NOW to prepare and QUALIFY this long march of young CITIZENS IN GOOD STANDING for what it'll take for them to get and hold a job that'll pay enough to provide for their participation in the nation's next adult generation? In effect, what programs exist now (at each level of government (or other authorities/industries/social resources) that a youth/young adult seeking a paying job can contact, learn from, and continue on into 'job seeking? If such contacts and guidance exists, have they been sufficiently publicized to the youth/young adults? What about a follow up system and staff for appropriate neighborhoods?<br /><br />Next point: (An untrained young adult has been employed as an apprentice by a 'small business' manufacturer. Following the paper work and a short tour of the work unit where he-she'll be assigned he/she is turned over to the 1st line supervisor who instructs him/her on his/her duties, which include several hands-on technical operations. (I was in a comparable situation way-back-when) MISTAKES HAPPEN!<br /><br />Enormous waste of resources occurs and lives lost because of mistakes and deficiencies in producing things and in industrial services. As a former (now long-retired) management analyst in a govt inspector general office and in other assignments, the scope of my responsibilities included manufacturing, maintenance, and later on, research and analysis of 'production' defects and abuse of materiel in both government and the private sectors. Often, the causes included poor procedures and training in getting at the 'root cause' of a problem. My experience is that normally, workers do not hide mistakes or minimize deficiencies. Further, on-the-job the worker is the 1st line supervisor's friend.<br /><br />Post-retirement, I prepared a pamphlet 1979 on fixing and preventing mistakes in the workplace that was published by the Small Business Administration. I occasionally update the pamphlet and the current version is on line at:<br /><br />http://scribe1917x.livejournal.com/9032.html<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Fixing and preventing mistakes and deficiencies in the workplace are everybody's business. At this particular time on our economic road back, it is literally vital that workers and especially supervisors returning to the 'job' and those new to a 'workplace' understand the nature of 'mistakes and deficiencies' and why they happen. Also, that first and second level supervisors (at least) be required to attend/participate in a training course that will include a 'how toâ&euro;Ś' on adapting 'options' in a general checklist to help them get at a problem's 'root causes.' </div><br />	Meyer Moldeven	8	9	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3199-4049

3202-4049	Link Federal Agency Collaboration to creating Coherent Public Participation Frameworks	2009-05-25 00:00:00	Many different federal agencies work on common issue areas. DOJ, Labor, HHS, Education, and others,for example, work on similar youth issues. In community, agency #1 may be trying to prevent juvenile delinquency while agency #2 is working on teen pregnancy prevention and agency #3 is working on youth employment (which is often an possible strategy for the work of agency #1 and #2). Each agency will require its own public participation and local collaboration strategy. Sometimes, these are completely separate siloed processes in the same community. That is a waste of effort and makes it virtually impossible to develop an integrated strategy.<br /><br />For key target areas (e.g., disconnected youth, livable communities, regional planning, etc.), each agency with relevant funding programs should be required to join with other agencies with relevant funding programs to streamline regulations, support unified public participation frameworks, and, in general, promote progress toward a shared set of outcomes.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Mandated public participation efforts linked only to siloed funding streams effectively disempower the communities which they are intended to serve. Conversations around funding streams can usually only tackle a narrow slice of the broader challenge making it very challenging to actually get real results.</div><br />	bill	29	30	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3202-4049

Some more eager constituents, many in desperate need, go to different agencies and politicians regarding the same issue. As a result, resources are wasted when different government employees are working on the same issue from different offices. Imagine a government-wide casework management tool, much like customer service centers of private companies, that will store information pertinent to constituent cases.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>There is a tremendous need for agencies and elected officials to share key casework information to save time and not duplicate work; to collaborate and bring constituents solutions to their problems.</div><br />	Dan Berger	0	4	4	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3203-4049

3205-4049	Develop Coherent Technical Assistance Strategies for States and Communities	2009-05-25 00:00:00	In the 1990s, the federal government, in a very rough estimate, was found to spend almost $100 million per year to hire technical assistance consultants to assist communities with the implementation of federal programs. These technical assistance consultants are often engaged to help communities develop and implement public-private collaboration frameworks and public participation strategies as well as other, more technical skills (e.g., financial management). Since many federal programs target the same low income communities, each federal program sends its own technical assistance consultants, who, at best, are not coordinated, and, at worst, provide contradictory advice.<br /><br />Federal agencies with federal to community (e.g., cities, counties, neighborhoods, etc.) funding programs should be required to develop a census of which programs funds which community and then develop coherent technical assistance plans that cut across funding streams.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Technical assistance consultants often play important go-between roles, providing support to communities based on guidance from the federal agency who hired them and providing information to federal agencies on their grantees. They often serve as de facto program managers because they have more contact with the grantee than the federal agency staff. In this role, they often use a heavy hand to guide the strategies and actions of the grantee. When there are multiple sets of technical assistance providers, there is often conflicting advice making it difficult to develop and implement coherent strategies on the ground.</div><br />	bill	10	10	0	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3205-4049

They use this hiring tool to the exclusion of veterans and minorities. Presently, this is a way for them to preclude veterans who should have a preference from getting jobs that they deserve to get.

3213-4049	Quality Data Key to Open Government	2009-05-25 00:00:00	A major question being posed now is: "How can we make government operations and programs more open/transparent and accountable?"<br /><br />Part of the answer is to get back to the fundamentals of getting good data about these operations and programs and ensuring that the underlying infrastructure that supports these programs, especially the systems and their accompanying processes is sufficient and effective. Since so much of the money distributed by the federal government is spent by the states and localities, it is imperative that a solid federal/state/local infrastructure be put in place supported by modern systems and common, well-understood data definitions and standards.<br /><br />Keys to success of open government hinge on the following:<br /><br />1) Availability of the Right Data at the Right Time<br />2) Quality of Data - Accuracy; Timeliness; Reliability; Data Standards; Internal Controls; Verification; Audit.<br />3) Access to the Data when needed<br />4) Ability to Turn Data into Information that can be easily used by citizens<br />5) Multiple ways to Disseminate the Information to Citizens<br /><br />Current Barriers:<br /><br />• Programs and systems at the federal level that you would need to provide data about the programs and program results (outputs, outcomes) were designed many years ago to support the processes of the programs and were not designed to collect data about program results. Further, the systems are old technology and are not nimble enough to respond to changing program requirements or demands for data or information. These need to be prioritized for modernization.<br /><br />• Good quality data is fundamental to transparency and evaluation of program results. As the federal/state and local governments have begun working on collecting data about the use of Recovery Act (Stimulus) funds, data quality issues are being discussed. The federal government and states are not accustomed to sharing information back and forth. There are issues about data definitions, who will report what in what form, security over reporting and how the data will be verified as accurate. The good news is they are all working together to face these challenges. However, the Recovery Act data at this point touches only on financial data - not the results of the use of the money. There does not yet exist agreements on outcomes (e.g., determining jobs created) or other measures of success. The same is likely true for many of the programs receiving other federal money through grants and other mechanisms.<br /><br />• There is currently a challenge in opening up timely data access to those who want it (systems/security/formats). There is also a challenge when raw data is opened up to ensure that those using it understand what the data fields represent (data definition) and the limitations on the data. Those providing the data must also ensure the quality of data.<br /><br />• In creating information from data the challenge becomes, whose information, i.e., which audience are you compiling it for and for what purpose? For "information self service" the challenge is providing easy to use tools, and understanding of the data and its limitations, as well as links to other supplementary or complementary sources.<br /><br />• Not all citizens have computers or will be able to use them, but they are consumers of and interested about the results of federal programs. How do you ensure information access by all citizens in forms and locations they can access?<br /><br />So how do we move forward? We start with some of the data, engage in dialogue on how best to "open it up" to useful information and move on from there.<br /><br />How do we do that? Well, when we were concerned about universal computer failure during Y2K, we rallied our will and resources to fix the computers that needed fixing and retiring those that did not. I suggest we could use a similar approach here:<br /><br />1) Conduct a review of each of the federal programs and determine a pilot set of those for full transparency. Building on those programs that also received Recovery Act funds might be a good place to start since those programs flow now throughout the states, localities and economy.<br /><br />2) Determine the financial (in process with Recovery Act reporting) and performance data needed to determine the effectiveness of the programs. (Invite participation of stakeholders/citizens to determine performance that matters.)<br /><br />3) Determine what data is needed and examine the current program systems and reporting mechanisms/tools to determine if they are adequate to support the program and the information needed about it.<br /><br />4) If the systems and processes for transparency are inadequate, plan to replace them - will need to prioritize to ensure success given limited financial and human resources.<br /><br />5) Once successful with the first group of programs, continue analysis with subsequent groups until completion.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Data quality and access and the infrastruture to support it is fundamental to open government</div><br />	patricia.healy	16	18	2	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3213-4049

(As an example, there is the Sunlight Foundation's API to look up information about congress people, or the Follow The Money API to look up information about lobbying and political contributions.)<br /><br />I notice the following:<br /><br />1. There are many and they are appearing (and probably disappearing) constantly. More are being added.<br /><br />2. For a 'consumer' (that would be a programmer) of this information it's pretty time consuming and error prone to study the documentation of each of these 'similar but different' APIs. Most are quite well documented but still each has to be discovered and studied separately.<br /><br />3. Creating applications (either browsers, or widgets, or middleware applications) that use and combine information from more than one source is hard.<br /><br />I would propose that the government adopt some kind of decentralized data discovery format which would eliminate each of the above problems. It would have the following characteristics:<br /><br />1. Allow a single access method to access a very broad range of data, numerical, textual and so on, but focused fundamentally on tabular information (broadly speaking.) <br /><br />2. Be easy and cheap to implement for the data/information owners/publishers<br />Specifically not require any centralization. Each data owner can independently decide what data to publish with Data RSS and when. New owners can appear and old ones can disappear with no coordination.<br /><br />I have a specific sample of what this format could look like and how to design and pilot it. I've placed all that work into the public domain.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The current approach to publishing data on government sites and data.gov is much too centralized and doesn't reflect the decentralized decision making present in our government.

This mandated Rule of Three, however is giving an unfair advantage to veterans, pre-dominantly male, and significantly hindering the government's ability to hire younger talent. I have seen a number of comments/concerns about the government's tendency to hire internally rather than externally, this is one of the reasons. When a vacancy is posted for the public, more often than not, veterans are placed at the top of the list, due to their point preference. This, in and of itself, is not bad and is a legitimate use of the point preference. The problem lies in the Rule of Three. If a veteran falls in the top three, any other candidates are excluded from consideration because we can't hire someone over a veteran. Where this becomes a problem is that 1) the veteran often has less experience or qualifications, thus their points are the only reason they have made it into the top 3; 2) the scores for the top three are determined based only on resume's, the scored questions, and without any input from the manager; 3) when a manager interviews the applicants, if the veteran does not interview well or is significantly less qualified, the manager has no option to hire someone else who is legitimately more qualified but is not a veteran.<br /><br />Proposed solution: Continue applying the point preference for veterans, however, do not restrict the manager from hiring another applicant they feel is more competent for the position.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea would open the doors for more newer employees that can bring in fresh and innovative ideas to the government, instead of perpetuating staleness.</div><br />	jb3600	-4	6	10	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3223-4049

There is much to be done.<br /><br />A few years ago, Canada's government officially enacted a Truth and Reconciliation process that is now going on, including widespread interviews with victims of government Residential Schools. Our government should do the same, and more, serving as a role model for China, Israel, Iran, or any country we wish to sit down and seriously talk with about "human rights" and "freedom". <br /><br />We need to change our public education to reflect a truer story of America's founding and development, and we need to change our current policies and land-use to reflect at least some of the original agreements that our government made at one time and then broke.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>If we want to actualize the American ideal of freedom, we must first fix the echoes of the holocaust-like oppressions that our government was founded upon. </div><br />	evan.mcgown	20	22	2	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3228-4049

3230-4049	Teach participation and empathy for others by teaching true history	2009-05-25 00:00:00	We have been engaged in 'nation destroying' with regard to other nations, and are quick to point a finger at others' so-called terrorist practices when they refuse to bend down and knuckle under. From our definition of 'all men are created equal' to include only White, properties males, with a certain religious persuasion, to our persecution of dissenters (although the Republic was founded on dissent), our invading the domain of other cultures, countries and races, we remain as a nation ignorant of our 'true history.' <br /><br />Start a collaborative project, through the use of original records, story-telling gathered from elders, and other 'true history' markers, to teach the history as it happened, and in the process, learn what it is that made us succeed and what made us into a target for terrorism and for worldwide hatred and despair. Endow this project with federal funds, as a way of affirming diversity and true origin. And let us see where this may lead us.<br /><br />True education builds understanding. Understanding is the first step toward a new nation dedicated to peace and to the empowerment not only of its people, but of all people in a planet conceived as a global village. That which hurts the smallest member hurts the entire body politic. Let us remember Donne's beautiful statement that every man's death diminishes me. <br /><br />All empires come to an end, some with more bloodshed than others. America is not a country, it is beautiful continents made up of many races, languages and beliefs.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>We are divided by our beliefs, racial and ethnic origin, languages, and economic class. We must begin to walk in our sister's moccasins in order to understand their path, and their needs. At a time of great economic and moral need, when we have been led astray by imperialistic greed, empathy through true education would allow us to begin to heal our national woes. </div><br />	lenguahispana	20	22	2	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3230-4049	
3231-4049	Make Agency Strategic Plans Realistic	2009-05-25 00:00:00	Agencies have been developing strategic plans since the 1990s, however, the plans often do not factor in the necessary funding and resources that will realistically be available to implement those plans. Strategic planning is an effective method for ensuring that all parts of the organization are working toward the same goals and objectives, including administration and technology. A clear assessment of the required funding, supplies and human resources should be included in every plan, with clear definitions of what can actually be accomplished based on different resource levels than what is requested.<br /><br />Recommendations:<br /><br />Strategic plans should be included in the congressional budget requests for each Agency, if they are not already. The Strategic Plan should be reviewed by Congress or by OMB to determine funding levels with the approval of these executives. The final approved plan should be the guiding tool for each Agency's funding, FTE allocations, and contracting. <br /><br />Strategic planning should be an ongoing, fully funded, annual function for each Agency - not an other duties as assigned function. Changes to the plan should reflect changing requirements for the Agency. Agencies should be required to annually document why funded goals in the plan have not been met. This would prevent spur of the moment changes during the year that become a sap on resources and do not reflect the direction of the Agency.<br /><br />Agencies need to realistically assess their talent pool and determine how to upgrade staff skills, hire new skills, or to contract portions of tasks.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea will ensure that Agencys stay focused on their mission and goals and defined and approved by Congress. It will provide the necessary resources to accomplish agreed upon objectives.</div><br />	jb3600	13	14	1	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3231-4049	
3232-4049	Empower the National Archives and Records Adminstration to enforce the JFK Records Act	2009-05-25 00:00:00	The JFK Records, passed unanimously by Congress in 1992, was a landmark in open government. To quell controversy about the causes of President John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963, the Congress mandated that the government release all assassination-related records in its position. The Congress also created an independent Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) to insure compliance with the law. The ARRB did an excellent job in reviewing and releasing more than 4 million pages of long-secret records related to JFK's murder. <br /><br />These records, written up in books such as David Kaiser's "The Road to Dallas," John Newman's "Oswald and the CIA," David Talbot's "Brothers," Gus Russo's "Live By the Sword," Lamar Waldon's "Ultimate Sacrifice," and Joan Mellen's "Farewell to Justice,", have contributed greatly not only to public understanding of the the assassination, and its confused investigatory aftermath but also to the history of the Kennedy administration and its policies on Cuba, Vietnam, organized crime, and civil rights. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the ARRB went out of existence in 1998. Responsibility for insuring enforcement of the act was transferred to the National Archives and Record Administration which, through no fault of its own, cannot enforce the law. Without the existence of an independent board specifically empowered to enforce the Act, NARA is unable to compel government agencies (with much bigger budgets and congressional clout) to review and release new JFK records as their existence becomes known to journalists, scholars and researchers. <br /><br />As a result, records that meet the statutory definiton of "assassination-related" remain secret in defiance of the intent of Congress and the will of the people.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The JFK assassination story remains a central event in the nation's history. As scholars find identify long-secret records relevant to this story, the government is reverting to traditions of secrecy that unnecessarily undermine public confidence and encourage conspiracy mongering. A new independent mechanism, like the Assassination Records Review Board, is needed to insure compliance with the JFK Records Act. </div><br />	morleyj	28	31	3	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3232-4049

Allowing a single company to take precedence over another because they own the road interferes in interstate commerce.<br /><br />By building a rail system that isn't owned by any one company we remove a companies right to place a passenger train on a siding because they don't own the rails.<br /><br />It also allows more shipping companies that are currently shipping via truck to compete directly with the current rail companies who own the tracks by buying their own trains and competing on an equal basis.<br /><br />Two sets of rails would allow a train to pass another without requiring it be put on a siding. <br /><br />Much of the right of way was originally public property, practically given away to the railway companies. <br /><br />Much of it was paid for by taxes. .

Legislation, originated by private companies, doesn't allow the post office to have their own air freight.

3238-4049	Moral Government and Priorities	2009-05-25 00:00:00	I don't have any answers--but I think this idea merits some thought and discussion. I believe that our leaders and decision makers need to use morality as a compass in their leadership. I understand the realities of the world--politics, money, international diplomacy, etc.. However, I believe that our leaders need to be guided by their most basic sense of humanity and right and wrong, when addressing our many social problems. The gross discrepancies in education, health care, and all things that entitle us all to "the pursuit of happiness", must be carefully examined--on both a national and international level--and decisions and solutions need to be made with the ideals of basic kindness and humanity as a top priority. <br /><br />Making government more inclusive and transparent is a wonderful idea--but I believe that it will only work if everyone who becomes involved is guided by a true sense of compassion. We do need to get involved--as a group of people who don't turn a blind eye to people sleeping on the pavement, unfairness and stigma towards the mentally ill, the pandemic of domestic abuse, the enormous populations of foster children and prisoners with drug addictions--and just as importantly, towards the immense suffering in places like Darfur.<br /><br />We need to understand and act, based upon all of the highly complex financial and diplomatic problems in the world. However, let's get together, as a "small group of committed citizens" who make changes with kindness, compassion, and equality as top priorities in our decision making and actions.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>There is far far too much suffering in the world.

3239-4049	Broaden targeted issue groups and encourage dialog	2009-05-25 00:00:00	Require broader input on federal legislation through a non-partisan "stakeholder bank" that is strictly utilized for input on federal legislation and rulemanking. This list cannot be shared outside of this specific purpose. Used sparingly and strategically, a well-tended, non-partisan electronic list of industry or interest-related contacts can provide thoughtful input to complicated, multi-criteria decisions. <br /><br />Using a catagorized, flexible database management system, identify stakeholders by issue, interest, profession and background. <br /><br />Broaden the groups to include organization and community networks who have not historically participated in government decisions, but share similar or shared professions or interests.<br /><br />Seek out women and minority participation. <br /><br />For more robust input, encourage discussion groups with established "issue hosts" whose job is to recruit and reflect input from their respective groups. Provide 2 - 3 key questions/considerations for group input, and ask for response.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>There are so many disengaged people who can lend incredible depth to federal discussion. They are to be sought out and given an easy tool to respond to issues that are relevant to their professions and interests. It is up to those seeking their input, to make it easy to participate and use their time wisely on issues they care about.<br /><br /><br /><br />Establishing a required stakeholder feedback system will add dimension to partisan or third-party-led input. Important to maximizing input is to establish neutral administration and protocol. Also important is to actively and diligently reach out to women and minorities.</div><br />	katy	16	19	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3239-4049	
3240-4049	Create a government-wide culture of transparency, collaboration, and participation	2009-05-25 00:00:00	The heart of any large scale change like this Transparency and Open Government initiative is the culture of the organization or institution (my definition of culture is included below). To have any hope of sustaining the changes implemented through this initiative, the culture of the Federal government needs to undergo a transformation. Without changing the culture, only surface changes will occur and the system will revert back to the old way of behaving. Only by embedding the new mindset and behavioral norms of transparency and open government deeply into the culture will the changes implemented through this initiative be sustainable through subsequent changes such as a change of parties, personalities, or priorities in the White House.<br /><br />But you can't just announce, "we're going to change our culture" and expect it to happen, even with so-called "change management programs." I have found that cultural change takes place most easily and most deeply when people change their own mindsets and behaviors rather than being told they have to. This takes place in the same way we change the way we think and behave in our personal lives. Email, the internet, and cell phones didn't become integral parts of our culture because people were told they had to use them. Most people chose to use them because they were "early adopters" or because their friends and peers were using them. Some people were first told by their employers that they had to use them but eventually grew accustomed and even dependent on them just by using them frequently for an extended time.<br /><br />This is how real change takes place, including for this initiative. Cultural change within the government needs to address all these ways people change: early adopters who will change just because they like to; followers who will change based on what they see their leaders and peers doing, as long as they have a choice and it makes sense to change; and reluctant adopters who will change first by being told to do so but eventually because it's just "the way things are done around here" and they become accustomed to it. You know the change is embedded when it becomes harder to go back to the old ways of thinking and behaving than to keep the new ones.<br /><br />There are already many ideas posted here that will help to bring about this cultural change if they are sustained over an extended period of time and they "make sense" to the people who have to implement and perform them. A number of the ideas involve ongoing dialogue and other means of encouraging more active participation by the public in government activities. I have found that one of the best ways to create a culture of transparency and participation is to make ongoing dialogue a core competency of the organization and a fundamental aspect of the operations of the organization. Another example of an idea that will help to bring about a change to the culture is "Integrate Participation and Collaboration into All Major Systems of Federal Agencies." If these ideas are implemented in a way that makes sense to the people who have to perform them after working with them for a while, there is hope that they will become accustomed to them and adopt them as the new "ways that things are done around here." This idea is meant to provide an "umbrella" that ties these other ideas together so that the conscious, deliberate intention to change the government culture becomes a key driver of making the implementation of these other ideas sustainable over the long term.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />What is "culture"?<br /><br />As an organizational anthropologist, I find that "culture" is one of those concepts that is always mentioned when talking about organizational change, but is usually not well understood. It has become more of a catch phrase than something that carries a common meaning.<br /><br />I like to think of culture as being certain visible and underlying aspects of a group of people, including a formally structured group such as an organization or an institution. The way culture manifests itself visibly in a group can be summed up as "how we do things around here." This can be viewed in the group as: the individual and collective behavior we can actually observe within the group, such as in a meeting together or talking on the phone; the rituals and symbols that seem to hold some special meaning for the group and are therefore used frequently by the group in their interactions with each other and with their external environment, such as how the group acknowledges its successes and mourns its setbacks (including the lack of any group means of expressing it); the ways people are motivated or de-motivated to follow prescribed procedures and behavioral norms, such as rewards and "punishments"; and the "artifacts" the group produces in its activities, typically "information artifacts" like documents, web pages, meeting notes, email messages, and other forms of documentation and communication. Understanding these information artifacts can be as important to understanding an organizational culture as archaeological artifacts are to understanding an ancient culture.<br /><br />But underlying this visible culture is what drives how things are done - the essence of the group or organization. This essence shapes the mindsets of the individuals working within the group. It includes their collective: identity (who they are); vision or aspirations (who or what they dream of becoming); purpose (why they exist); and values and beliefs (what they believe in and hold most dear). What the group espouses as their essence (as evidenced through their documentation and communication) vs. what they actually practice (as evidenced through their actual behaviors) is another underlying aspect or driver of the group's culture.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>To have any hope of sustaining the changes implemented through this initiative, the culture of the Federal government needs to undergo a transformation. Without changing the culture, only surface changes will occur and the system will revert back to the old way of behaving. Only by embedding the new mindset and behavioral norms of transparency and open government deeply into the culture will the changes implemented through this initiative be sustainable through subsequent changes such as a change of parties, personalities, or priorities in the White House.</div><br />	Arian Ward	23	24	1	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3240-4049

3242-4049	We Must Turn Off the Heat	2009-05-25 00:00:00	The largest fragments of what this document hopes to become are made available at irregular intervals at www.agkaiser.org click on "The Latest" which at this writing is: May 23, 2009 .<br /><br /> If you heat water on your stove, it warms more quickly with a lid on the pot. When it's reached the desired temperature, it's not sufficient to merely remove the lid, so that the energy escapes faster. You've got to turn off the heat. You must stop putting more energy into it. We can't turn off the Sun. We can't turn off volcanoes or prevent all wildfires. There are other natural phenomena that we can't turn off. Our responses to Global Warming are limited to the things we do that contribute to it. <br /> Global Warming is acknowledged as a growing threat to life as we know it. We of the Planet Earth, to the extent that we have caused this danger, must face it together. The heat that's produced from stored [mostly] carbon energy sources is probably the primary cause of Global Warming and certainly the only one over which we have any control. The increased thermal efficiency of the air blanket, caused by the movement of carbon from within the solid Earth to the atmosphere, retards the outflow of heat from the Planet and slows our rotation on our axis,* to be sure. Worse, every molecule containing carbon releases energy in the form of heat as it's emitted. There's also energy input to our system each day from the Sun. Beyond the heat and light we come by naturally, it's the stored energy extracted from carbon sources, plus more from geothermal and nukes, that can be reduced. Those latter three, the stored energy sources, are the cause of the extraordinary warming that we can moderate. <br />* Dubious? Conservation of angular momentum is what accelerates or decelerates the rotational velocity of a spinning skater, as the arms are extended or retracted. The effect of our skyscrapers and carbon emissions on the length of the day may be very small and not the only factors, but the slowing is measurable. Anything that displaces mass outward from the center of the Earth will retard our Planet. - http://www.slate.com/id/2133359/ <br /><br /> This seems so obvious that it requires some reflection to understand why so many scientists and engineers seem not to have noticed that it's the energy, the extra heat we add to the system from millions or billions of years old stored sunlight that is the starting point of the oncoming Global Warming Catastrophe. To concentrate on the carbon we add to the atmosphere and ignore the heat, is self destructive and self delusional. Have the thinkers simply been stampeded with the herd that seeks more energy at great profit for producers and any cost to ourselves? Are the technical leaders as greedy and foolish as the rest or are their salaries, grants and bourgeois lifestyles hitched to the pleasure and whims of bankers and investors? <br /> Subjugation by neo-aristocracy makes the bourgeoisie more like the rest of US commoners than they want to believe. Our lives are ruled by the elite investor class. Whether or not we're lucky enough to be among the shrinking middle classes, we're most of US in this together. We must face the fact that the Planet is getting warmer and that it's the energy we add to the environment, which doesn't come in each day's ration of sunlight over which we have no control, that is the villain. We must see that the Law of Conservation of Matter and Energy is universal. It even rules the economy that rules US. The conservative physical universe is the ultimate zero sum game. <br /><br /> The floating ice that melts won't raise the sea level. Archimedes taught the world about buoyancy a few years ago. However the glaciers in the Andes and elsewhere, and the Greenland ice cap will raise the oceans, whether the solid water melts or merely slides into the sea.[ibid] But there are more immediate disasters looming. The glaciers in South America, whose summer melt feeds the rivers on which millions depend for life, are shrinking. Glaciers in Peru are melting so quickly that by 2015 almost all of them may have disappeared.1 Six million live in the city of Lima, Peru alone. More rural high country agricultural peoples, who've lived there thousand of years and haven't benefited at all from the energy we use, will no longer be able to support their lives, even if they move to the cities first. - John Vidal Cities in peril as Andean glaciers melt - Ten percent of the world's population live in low lying coastal areas. If the sea rises one meter 600 million people may be displaced or severely impacted.2 Not everyone is a cynical conservative or brain dead libertarian who would simply let this happen. <br /> Why don't the honest non co-opted scientists and engineers say that it's not just the carbon? The carbon emissions aren't the critical part of the disaster. It's the energy emissions, which carbon emissions accompany in the case of fossil fuels, that are heating the global environment. Carbon is a red herring, when we concentrate on it and ignore the energy we put into the environment. Carbon cap and trade is an associated distraction and a non solution that forgives the rich for the evil they do. It allows them to use the wealth they've taken from the community that produced it, to buy the permission to pollute even more.3 <br /> Carbon energy sources are sunlight that was stored in the Earth millions or billions of years ago. Though more recently stored, even the wood or other biomass that's burned provides heat from past sunlight. The nukes were made in stars. Geothermal was packed in by gravity long ago. Only sunlight that's incident on Earth today gives energy and heat that will be here anyway. Winds are a manifestation of today's ration of solar power - or at least they used to be. The energy in the tides is an immediate effect of gravity. No matter what transduction such energies undergo, or don't, their contribution to global warming remains the same. They are inevitable. We have no control over the Sun, Stars and Moon. The immediate energy they give US is the baseline. We can and must control our usage of stored energy - especially that which comes from hydrocarbons, which have the additional ill effect of increasing the thermal efficiency of the atmosphere. <br /> "Real alternative fuels are non carbon based. Only energy produced by burning non carbon based fuels minimizes the contribution to the average temperature of the atmosphere." - from /home/agk/literature/musings/2006/notes_08-06.wpd - this is the earliest reference that I've found, which was written by me, to the differentiation of carbon [stored] energy and incident sunlight - August 3, 2006 <br /> So we see that the carbon added to the atmosphere by burning [especially] fossil fuels is directly proportional to the heat/energy that causes the increase of the average temperature of the global environment. We also see that the carbon released with the heat, mostly in the form of CO2 but with heavier and more detrimental molecules as well, helps to retard the outflow of energy through our thin blanket of air. Make no mistake. It's the heat we add to the environment, not the retardation of thermal flow to space by carbon, that is the prime threat. <br /><br /> I've heard it said that there's not enough energy in sunlight to supply our needs. That assertion is probably very specious. What's true is that we don't know how to extract it. So, using the technology of the day in which the statement was made, not enough energy from the Sun could be generated to provide for our often extravagant usage. How much energy is spent by tornadoes and hurricanes? The wind is powered by the Sun. All the plant and animal growth is powered by the Sun. But the sheople keep saying that we can't continue functioning as we do with solar energy. Does that mean that if we're a self destructive species we must continue on that suicidal path set forth by our progenitors and the wealthy patrons who despoil the community for personal gain? <br /><br /> I'll recap. The established energy producers, scientists, engineers and most politicians and the public are convinced that we need to use even more energy to continue our way of life. Most also concede that global warming is real and needs attention. The "common wisdom" [an oxymoron] is that the warming can be stemmed by the reduction of carbon emissions. Such speciousness ignores the actual cause of higher temperatures, which is the heat emissions that are the reason for carbon emissions and are part and parcel to any use of energy stored in past years. This is the part for which we are responsible and over which we have control. <br /> Not all energy that's input to our global ecosystem can be controlled. There's little chance we can stem the instantaneous flow of solar energy. That is the baseline of global energy accrual by the Planet. It is the use of stored sunlight that is causing the extraordinary global warming. It was put up hundreds of millions of years ago, when it comes from fossil fuels like coal, oil or natural gas; billions for nukes, made in stars, and the gravitational accumulation that accounts for geothermal. And it is that usage that we can and must control. If not, we may find ourselves with no sustainable lifestyle. So what can we do about it? <br /><br />Coming soon to the ". . . Independent Energy . . ." website: prototype solar electric installation that diminishes dependence on centrally planned power systems and reduces carbon pollution and energy emissions from stored sources.<br /><br />1 http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/13/climatechange.colombia <br />http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/apr2008/2008-04-28-01.asp <br />http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN0725512820070607 <br />http://www.scidev.net/en/news/peru-may-lose-glaciers-by-2015.html <br />2 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7935159.stm <br />3 Cap and Trade that allots Carbon credits to polluting industries and allows trade among themselves exacerbates the "market solution" fraud that is at the root of all of our problems and the greatest existential threat to the survival of the Human Race and Life in general on the Planet Earth. But if the license to pollute was given to we consumers, whose desires [demand] usually get the blame for any shortcomings of capitalism, we could sell them to the producers who profit by ecological destruction in the first place.

3244-4049	Public dialogue on web platforms produces informed deliberation and increases confidence in government	2009-05-25 00:00:00	There's hesitation in government to use the web to engage the public in dialogue. This seems to be because conversations on the web look disorganized and can feel hostile. We've found that, if it's designed properly, web-based dialogue can be positive and productive for agencies. How can we reassure government agencies that they won't be eaten alive on the web?<br /><br />WestEd has been conducting public dialogues on the web to support public involvement in policy development since 2003. We have found that there is more to this than just opening up a blog, and that careful design can allow participants to become better informed about the issue, they deliberate with each other on difficult and contentious issues, and build confidence in government agencies that they would otherwise distrust. We have designed and facilitated web dialogues that:<br /><br />1. Give government a platform that permits transparency and trust-building<br /><br />2. Increase opportunities for citizen participation. It's true that participants need a link to the Internet. However, there are many interested parties who have Internet connections but are unable to attend public meetings because of their location, the cost of travel, their childcare commitments, their work, etc. etc.<br /><br />3. Increase the quality of citizen participation: it includes geographic diversity in a single conversation (watershed communities that are upstream and downstream, interested parties from the north and south, people from the East Coast and West Coast, local interests and national interests, etc.); it provides opportunities for participants to ponder and consider others' postings before responding (instead of "dialogue" at public meetings that may sound more like "dueling", the web-based process is asynchronous and written); it allows for several discussions simultaneously; it allows participants to initiate and join their own sub-discussions; it provides the sponsoring agency with a useful written record; it permits subject-matter experts to introduce information and advice throughout the discussion.<br /><br />Here are some examples of public deliberation on policy development conducted in WebDialogues organized by WestEd:<br /><br />1. Water Quality in the Great Lakes and St Lawrence River: an international, bilingual public discussion about water quality in a watershed that stretches for more than 1,000 miles. Sponsored by the International Joint Commission. http://archive.webdialogues.net/cs/ijc-greatlakes-home/view/di/77?x-t=home.view<br /><br />2. Prioritization of Vaccination in an Influenza Pandemic: a nation-wide public discussion to inform the development of the politically sensitive policy to determine who should be the first to receive vaccine in an influenza pandemic. Sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, and the National Association of City and County Health Officials:<br />http://www.webdialogues.net/cs/panflu-engage/view/di/104?x-t=home<br /><br />3. Achieving Success for All Students: a state-wide dialogue in California among teachers, students, parents, administrators, board members, the business community, and others about ways to improve the achievement of California students who struggle the most. Sponsored by the California Department of Education:<br />http://www.webdialogues.net/cs/ctag-studentsuccess-home/view/di/126?x-t=home.view<br /><br />4. For access to 27 public WebDialogues, produced since 2003, go to<br />http://www.webdialogues.net/pub/htdocs/archives.htm<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>A practical strategy for agencies to solicit widespread public input, help citizens become better informed on the issue under discussion, and cultivate collaboration among folks who are interested in the issue under discussion. Host organization staff can frame the conversation, produce the dialogues and mine the content without technical expertise. We believe this strategy is the beginning of the "next frontier" of public engagement. To be successful, it must meet the needs of all stakeholders -- hosting agencies, subject matter experts and the public. Our goal is to develop an open source platform to provide a framework for rapid and effective development of the web-based engagement strategy and supporting software.</div><br />	lmaak	42	43	1	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3244-4049

There are many from the American aerospace, automotive, agricultural, electronics, defense, and other industries who can use their systems improvement experience and training to improve governmental operations and stimulus-funded programs. And as an added win-win, many of these experts are looking for work right now due to the layoffs and cutbacks in these industries.<br /><br />There have already been strong improvements seen with state-level and defense agencies that have employed these techniques, as reported by the national media, professional publications, and state and military offices. Some examples are:<br />http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/dec/26/business/chi-ap-oh-kaizencraze<br />http://das.ohio.gov/ASD/PDFs/LegislativeUpdate-July2008.pdf<br />http://lean.iowa.gov<br />http://results.ohio.gov<br />http://www.maine.gov/dhhs/btc<br />http://www.defenselink.mil/dcmo/index.html<br />http://www.army.mil/ArmyBTKC/focus/cpi/tools3.htm<br />http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/get-newsletter.pl?LEAN&20081007&1&<br /><br />The Administration and Congressional leaders can show the public that they are a) making government even more effective, efficient, and faster to respond, b) saving the taxpayers money, c) making our national economy even stronger and more competitive, d) ensuring the nation still benefits from some of America's most valuable technical education and experience, and e) returning some of our nation's best trained citizens to the ranks of the employed.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It simultaneously saves taxpayer money, improves government efficiency, strengthens our economy, and employs some of our best trained citizens from the US industrial base.</div><br />	readercitizen	15	16	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3245-4049

Much of the remains of the World Trade Center were simply carted to a landfill without being investigated forensically. Also, the NYPD prevented the New York City firefighters from going into the site to search for the remains of their brethren who were trapped and killed in the building on 9/11. The real story of 9/11 should be investigated.

It would be good to have a category specifically for feedback and suggestions about this site as well. Several of the best suggestions have been about making the site more useful. I agree that the numbers of votes should be shown, not just the ranking.

3268-4049	Measures to track, report, and improve government transparency and openness	2009-05-26 00:00:00	One of the best ways to create accountability is through measurements that track how well an organization is performing against established targets. These measures would provide a means of tracking, reporting, and improving the transparency and openness this initiative is intended to implement. This system of accountability should include:<br /><br /> Success or results measures - How do we measure success? What are the results we're trying to achieve and how will we know we've produced those results? An example of a results measure is the final vote in an election. An example of a possible transparency and openness results measure is a public satisfaction index as measured by some type of survey or voting process. The desired result would be to achieve some target percentage of public satisfaction with the transparency and openness of the government. Another example would be the percentage of the American adult population who participated in the government process in some way - participating in a dialogue, providing feedback on some proposed action, visiting a website where these measures or proposed government actions are published, etc.<br /><br /> Performance or progress measures - How do we determine if we're making progress towards success? How can determine if we're on or off track in moving towards the success or results we are trying to create? A performance measure provides early visibility of progress that enables corrective action to be taken before the results are due. It should correlate as closely as possible to the results measure. A performance measure used to assess progress towards the election results measure is tracking polls. An example of a possible transparency and openness performance measure is the number or percentage of governmental organizations who have fully implemented the transparency and openness program defined by this initiative. Another example would be the percentage of government documents that have been made available to the public.<br /><br /> Reporting/publishing of the measures - Just like organizations often use a "dashboard" of measures to track their results and performance, the Federal government should maintain an online transparency and openness dashboard that allows both the government and the public to view results and performance.<br /><br /> Measures by organization as well as government-wide - Each major organization of the government should track its results and performance and report them on the dashboard website. These would be rolled into the overall government dashboard measures plus there could be some measurements done only at the overall government level.<br /><br /> Continuous improvement process - The primary purpose of measures inside an organization is to provide a feedback mechanism for an organization to know how well it's doing so it can keep improving. The primary purpose for measures external to the organization is to hold the organization accountable for what it's supposed to be doing and achieving. Both of these feedback mechanisms should result in the continuous improvement of the government's transparency and openness. For example, when the target level of public satisfaction is reached, the government shouldn't just be satisfied that it's done all it can.

Millions of our citizens have been incarcerated for nonviolent drug offences.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Marijuana laws are more harmful to people and families than the drug itself. <br /><br />The 'War on Drugs' is ineffective. Billions of dollars are put into the criminalization of people using/selling a drug that has positive applications. Will you relax the federal rules concerning serious, scientific research into medicinal uses for marijuana and any associated long-term effects? We need to stop prosecuting medical marijuana patients.<br /><br /><br /><br />Legalization of marijuana could help bring our nation out of it's economic crisis with proper taxing and laws. Legalizing cannabis/marijuana/hemp so that the government can regulate it, tax it, and put age limits on it will create millions of new jobs and a multi-billion dollar green industry right here in the U.S.<br /><br /><br /><br />How is the prohibition of Marijuana any different than the prohibition of alcohol? 100,000 Americans die every year due to alcohol but none to Marijuana. It is our choice what we put in our bodies and the fact that the government thinks it can control these choices is an insult not only to marijuana smokers, but to anyone who values freedom.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Drug War has been an incredibly expensive failure since it's inception.

3277-4049	A Critical Examination of the Existing Educational Paradigm:Its Framework, Processes, and Systems	2009-05-26 00:00:00	A Critical Examination of the Existing Educational Paradigm:<br />Its Framework, Processes, and Systems ©<br /><br /> "America's high schools are obsolete. By obsolete, I don't just mean that they're broken, flawed or just underfunded, though a case could be made for every one of those points. By obsolete, I mean our high schools - even when they're working as designed--cannot teach all our students what they need to know today." <br />by Bill Gates<br /><br />PREFACE<br />Although one may be certain that there is no single remedy to resolve the problem of what ails education, it must be noted that the existing framework supporting the present system of a standardized, one-size-curricula-fits-all model, in an all-out effort to funnel age-related cohorts lock-step through high school, is indeed, obsolete as Mr. Gates dutifully contends. I totally agree with and acknowledge his sentiment. The truth is our present system was not designed to teach students the skills needed for a global economy. Furthermore a warning: Do not count on entrenched educational leaders to do any more than reactively resort to patchwork policy measures that shall continue to bolster dysfunctional public education.<br />In fact, as long as the existing public education paradigm's framework is supported by the current funding process, then the present system and those responsible for its operation will continue to have little or no incentive to innovate in order to meet new challenges. A system comprised of quasi-professionals, supported by a nontransparent, unstable funding process, and finally, propped up by an obsolete paradigm is deeply mired in its own drama, and over time has demonstrated its inadequacy to cope with the challenges of preparing public school students to function effectively in a global 21st century environment. That much is for sure. Expecting improvement, by using the existing paradigm, is against all odds of success. Thus, the impetus of most PK-14 state level, lobbyist-initiated reform measures or even a few grassroots/local level efforts "aimed at solving problems and resolving issues" usually get weaker the longer they limp along and eventually die from apathy or as I refer to it "death by blandness." These attempts at reform (while acknowledging that a few are initially well-intentioned efforts) amount to mere tweaking an outmoded paradigm. Albeit, to those on the outside looking in, any effort aimed at change is perceived as a positive.<br />I have reached this conclusion based on over five decades from both sides of an instructors' desk as well as from career experience in a variety of educational situations: from special education programs designed for working with gifted students to working with students deemed mentally challenged; from employment in more "traditional school settings" to a state penitentiary community college setting; from commitment to a K-12 parochial school environment to commitment to a K-12 public school environment; from teaching at-risk student athletes to teaching at-risk adults; from attending kindergarten-grammar school to finishing law school; from the perspective of a discontented teenage student to that of a more thoughtful adult instructor; and finally, to a more insightful professional administrator. <br />Throughout the gamut of our my professional experience, I maintained a classroom instructor's point of view with a mindset focused on identification of all aspects of instructional best practices: a) developing effective disciplinary strategies and time management tactics; b) utilizing appropriate methodological applications and delivery systems to enhance knowledge transfer; c) ensuring curriculum relevance in the content area; d) maintaining the highest level of course-content rigor; and finally, d) increasing human potential through reliable and valid performance measures of individual achievement.<br />During the last twenty years, many national report cards that compare state-to-state data have found Alabama education practices and student achievement levels consistently below par. Some claimed that where scarce resources exist for education, as is the case in Alabama's Educational Trust Fund (ETF), funding inequities among all K-14 systems and Higher Education will continue. Others argued, "Whether there has ever been enough revenue generated to adequately fund an 'appropriate' public education." However, for educational leadership to engage in continual turf battles and to quarrel over funding-level formulas is like paramedics performing triage on cadavers - it is an exercise in futility and fails to address more pressing long term needs. <br />Our nation's continued preeminence on the world stage is reliant on a superior-trained faculty cohort whose continuing professional development aims at implementing instructional best practices including the following: a) employing effective classroom management as well as time management skills; b) understanding age appropriate social-psychological behavior; c) utilizing methodologies and technological delivery systems to accommodate diverse learning styles; d) adopting seamless web career counseling from early childhood; e) developing appropriate performance measures to gauge individual academic achievement; f) prescribing individual remediation measures; and g) developing dropout profiles that proactively focus on preventative interventions instead of prison as a last resort. Even with recent, significant improvements in Alabama's public schools, the evidence continues to demonstrate results that remain far from outstanding. It should serve as a wake-up call to all: What is going on inside our classrooms is serious business and failure to resolve recurring issues will have severe economic consequences. Furthermore, although it is unfortunate and often contrary to reason, I believe that as long as the existing, paradigmatic framework continues to sustain the entrenched agenda of the status quo - - a genuine, authentic response to the problem shall remain an untenable reality. Consequently, the objective of this report is to establish in the public consciousness the need for constructive dialogue among all stakeholders in an effort to validate the authenticity of perceived reality. In other words, I propose a pilot program to accomplish on a small scale what I believe can and must be sustained on a large scale: A New American School. <br />This study demonstrates those precise economic development linkage points that by necessity demand administrative leadership and accountability throughout the public education framework. Moreover, the explicit recommendations in the accompanying Action Plan are not intended to infer a final destination; but rather, to point towards a new American school. James Henley (Jim) Hethcox, J.D., Ed.D, MCP (April 9, 2009)<br /><br />Overview<br />The American education transfer process essentially entails the transfer of past generations' culture, factual knowledge base, and core values. The current public educational experience in the U.S. has its roots in the early 1900s. The educational establishment solution to the problem of ensuring a large labor pool existed to meet increasing demands of industrial assembly lines was to design instructional programs that could mass-produce public school graduates. Further complicating the problem was the integration into the workforce of not only an unskilled, semi-literate, homegrown cliental, but millions of non-English speaking immigrants as well. <br />It may or may not have been the best way to educate millions of non-English speaking Europeans; however, it could be argued that the then-existing educational establishment's response to a burgeoning industrial sector's insatiable demand for human resources was resourceful as well as a practical solution. For example, the era between 1895-to-1939 overwhelmingly demonstrated the effectiveness of repetitive instructional programs designed to introduce age-related cohorts to a "minimum course of study." The apparent success of that intervention, unfortunately, created a paradigm whose processes and systems have reified.<br />Moreover, anachronistic policies and procedures that range from teacher credentialing to institutional accreditation are firmly entrenched. The current myriad legislative funding processes and county or city or metro administrative systems are necessary and vital to support and maintain the establishment status quo which regrettably has little or no incentive to adapt and respond to a practical, resourceful solution to the unique requirements of yet unknown future circumstances. <br />Throughout the turmoil of the Great Depression, WW II, the baby boom, and racial integration, second and third generation immigrant families continued to assimilate through the local public and parochial school systems. Given the fact that a century old solution to a then pressing workforce development problem is no longer relevant in our current global economy, why do we continue to support and to maintain processes and systems that lethargically mass-produce students? Why, given the tremendous advances in our understanding of cognitive development and computer technology, is the PK -14 educational transfer process virtually the same as it was in the 1960s? Visit a PK-14 classroom during a lecture, if you don't believe it.<br />What if the emphasis on student testing mandated, albeit unfunded at the federal level, by NCLB has unintended consequences? For example, student achievement may soon become a euphemism for "meet and/or exceed group standardized test objectives," rather than a valid and reliable measure of individual cognitive ability. Ironically, the dysfunction of the traditional public education paradigm may ultimately prove to be directly correlated with the increasing number of those who choose to opt-out, i.e., "drop-out." <br />What if a portion of those students who opt-out are actually more perceptive, more demanding of content rigor, more inclined to think critically and challenge authority than those who placidly remain in their desks? What if opt-outs "pierce the veil" and perceive that the traditional school setting, by offering an extended childhood to all those willing to abide contentedly, nonetheless exhibits signs of a human-warehouse mechanism designed to maintain the nations' labor pool at a consistent level? What if, in addition to the poor learner or slow student, our nation is forfeiting its best and brightest-- a gifted segment? What if disgruntled opt-outs perceive concerted state efforts to "stay in school" amount to little more than coercive abuse of the states' police power to mandate an intellectually boring, redundant, minimal program of study that by default punishes the non-conformist and anyone else who question its authenticity?<br />Perhaps, to many parent/caregivers the conventional perception of education has been that it is something that happens to children and adolescents, and then finally, it is over - - with the beneficiary fully equipped to face adult life. For decades, this was the conventional view of education that has held sway over not only caregivers; but also, policy makers in the United States. Nevertheless, neither caregivers nor policy makers are engineers by profession and should not be expected to be aware of the typical engineering school dilemma, i.e., by the time graduates receive an engineering degree, approximately half of what they learned in the beginning has already become irrelevant (White House Science Council, 1986).<br />Those on the economic development bandwagon inside the educational establishment seek to court industry through slick-finished, tri-fold brochures and resort to the use of buzzwords such as "continuing and lifelong education" or "competing in a global economy." What essential concepts lie behind the professional jargon? What are the real implications? If "continuing and lifelong" implies from cradle to grave, then continuing education courses are presently the best solution to the engineering school dilemma; in addition to maintaining proficiency among all professions. However, such phrases have serious implications including the way in which traditional instructional delivery systems operate and the manner in which curriculum innovations are designed to more closely parallel the unique needs of 21st century public and private sector employers as well as the students they seek to employ. In the face of mounting obstacles to remain competitive, clichés are only the answer if one is satisfied with counterfeit gestures and public posturing. Furthermore, if the proper questions are not posed to decision makers and policy wonks, then what difference does it make which answers they spin?<br />If we are not willing to admit the present system's unequivocal inability to perform at an acceptable level, then it is highly unlikely we shall be willing to take vital measures necessary to arrive at the next level. It is a truism that only when an individual hits bottom can meaningful change and rehabilitation begin. Perhaps that holds true for institutions as well. For too long, the armed forces and private-sector employers have had to spend billions per year to (re)train recent graduates simply to perform basic skills. Faced with mounting operating cost, the day will come when employers will finally balk at funding a sole, state-operated enterprise that fails to deliver warranted merchandise. Consequently, further analysis and/or recommendations, by legislatively appointed either blue ribbon committees or executive appointed commissions, of policies, programs, and initiatives shall no longer be seen as a sign that "help is on the way." <br />While high schools must be held accountable for the lack of college and workplace readiness among their graduates, unprepared students represent a failure of the entire PK-16 system -- -- a dysfunctional academic pipeline with weak standards and misaligned policies. Policy makers have long approached the high school and higher education systems as independent entities, whose practices do whose practices do not impinge on one another. This is even true at the federal level, where most education legislation focuses on either K-12 or higher education (Boser, Ulrich and Burd, Stephen, 2009). <br />Since the late 1980s, foreign nationals increasingly have enroll at American colleges and universities rather than choosing to matriculate at any other countries' higher education institutions, including their own. The irony is that American PK-14 student achievement scores indicate skills that are sorely lacking compared to other developed nations who send their better academically-prepared child to benefit from our superior, research-oriented, Tier 1 institutions. As a consequence, the more the public demands from Pk-12, the higher the expectation becomes, until the teaching profession is at a lost to explain lack of "student performance" except to point towards the "Fruit not falling far from the tree" theory of HRD. In any event and regardless of who is to blame, a direct results of the consequences of our cumulative behavior has become our shame: As HRD dries up and dies on the vine, so does our ability to invent and innovate.<br />Our nation needs citizens that have been prepared to be productive. Yet one-third of students who enter the ninth grade never graduate from high school. Clearly, the United States cannot accept a 33 percent failure rate if it is to keep pace economically and militarily (SREB, 2007).<br /><br />Billions of scarce dollars are wasted on postsecondary student remediation in a bizarre attempt to academically prepare them to attend two year college or state and land grant institutions. Unfortunately, after all the time, money, and energy spent to remediate unprepared American students approximately twenty per cent (20%) of entering freshman will complete a degree program in seven years (NCES, 2005).<br />This dysfunctional, 19th Century paradigm continues to distort what should be public educations' essential mission in the 21st Century - - human capital, formerly conceived as man-hour mass labor, now transformed by the burgeoning demands for knowledge workers. Conscious development of an individual's unique potential joined to others flowing through a process-pipeline of human resource development activities then finally, pouring over a spillway - - out into a vast reservoir . . . a pool of human talent. <br />If the locomotive that drives the train of a state's economic development is higher education, then its effectiveness demands a more comprehensive role involving higher education in the entire educational process from kindergarten through graduate school. Resolving the issue of how to proceed with such an arrangement involves posing the fundamental question -- What is the purpose of public education? <br />The posing of that particular question by enough concerned individuals shall establish the initial motivation for beginning a process that leads to strategic planning. A successful strategic plan, when implemented embodies future aspirations in the form of goals and objectives. Each advance is a necessary step to achieve the missions' purpose. Finally, parents, students, and all other stakeholders/ grandparents /interested parties/ employers, i.e., industry, small business owners, local government, must demand a blueprint for a new American school. With the goal of such a blueprint in mind, let us consider our weakest lynchpin, the perilous nexus whereby PK-14 fails to connect fully with the end link - - American higher education institutions.<br /><br />Strategic Decision Model<br />Proof of well-conceived strategic decisions is most amply demonstrated when tactical decisions integrate with operational decisions, so that as a natural consequence, the strategic vision that set the process in motion is "in sync" with reality, instead of being stretched over reality like an ill-fitting bed sheet. Consequently, our purpose should act as a compass to provide direction so that our mental map not only absorbs a comprehension of the whole; but is able to conceive an insight into the most advantageous tactical and operational directives that will guide us successfully to our destination, i.e., demonstrate the means necessary for initiating specific goals in order to obtain desired results. <br />A proper purpose must be derived from an honest examination of perceived strengths and weaknesses that informs the total educational design process. The most crucial factor in the entire design process centers on whether its collaborators / authors shall have the resolve to be able to successfully initiate, execute, and complete the action plan portion of the strategic plan. It is solely the responsibility of the leadership to acknowledge: Whether the entire community prospers or fails to prosper shall ultimately be determined by the leaderships' ability to anticipate the long-term needs, to identify all available resources, and to develop human capital to meet those needs in order to be able even to compete in a 21st Century global economy.<br />Moreover, if the first round of discussion leads to proposed changes that prove too great a challenge for the existing system to implement, then the leadership is duty-bound to be adaptable, retrench and anticipate where remaining interests exist to overcome remaining differences, and be able to adopt another plan and place it on the examination table. If that examination proves fruitful, then let that mandate be the call to action. The following model exemplifies that goal:<br /> Strategic Decisions: Establish the major parameters for organizational effort and generally answer the question - - What are we going to do?<br /> Tactical Decisions: Derived from strategic decisions (above) and help answer the question - - How are we going to do it?<br /> Operational Decisions: Establish procedures and answers the question- - Who will do what?<br />(Chaffee, 1983)<br />Thus, the responsibility for initiating and executing the recommended actions of a strategic plan falls on the leadership. Finally, it is critical to the success of our mission that we become more conscious of the value of language's precision and accuracy i.e., "terms of art" to describe the educational characteristics that drive the strategic plan.<br />• Paradigm - A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality for the community that shares them, especially in an intellectual discipline.<br />• Process Innovation is the act of engagement in basic research, distribution of findings, and assistance to anyone whose applied research interests is in using those findings i.e., converting them into a useful concept/product/service.<br />• Process Innovation Pipeline Completion Cycle - a collaborative group action similar to the Manhattan Project that involves 1) performing basic research from conception to dispersal of findings, and 2) using applied research skills in order to convert basic research findings into a concept that provides a product or service useful to a niche market. <br />• Imagineer - a highly skilled person in process innovation professionally trained to marshal required forces through a completion cycle pipeline in order to meet established group goals and team objectives.<br />All of the following educational characteristics are referenced in terms of a distinctive American educational paradigm:<br />• Framework - a reified, institutional apparatus that lobbies for the status quo.<br />• Process - a legislatively, legally-appropriated, publicly-funding scheme designed to foster the goals and objectives of interests vested in the preservation of the status quo.<br />• System - by and large, a chain of command, administratively-driven, organizational reaction to allocate formerly appropriated tax dollars ostensibly to make available a professional, instructional, public agenda that, among other things, seeks to assimilate the desires inherently a part of American social change, patched together for over a century, and is most often referred to as (or poses as) education.<br />• HRD - Human Resource Development (HRD), more aptly characterizes what most really mean when referring to education. The term Human Resource Development (HRD), more aptly characterizes what most people really mean when referring to education. Consequently, HRD involves integration of four essential elements inherent in the human maturation process (PK-16) that include the following:<br />1. a highly-trained, nurturing professional skilled at enabling an individual to achieve means to discover their own potential, <br />2. a societal comprehension and appreciation of each and every individual's potentially, unique contribution, <br />3. an innovative system and process that facilitates HRD by utilizing the existing public education framework, where possible, in the most appropriate, efficient manner, and <br />4. a local dedication to inculcate the value of the rigorous approach required for sustaining a life-long and continuing, cradle-to-grave, personal commitment to knowledge acquisition.<br /><br />Introduction<br />By the end of summer 1969, The United States of America had executed the plan to put human beings on the moon within the decade. Fourteen years later, a challenge no less daunting was raised when the findings from A Nation at Risk (1983) confronted the educational establishment and launched a media blitz to reform our public schools. Although the sense of urgency that prompted the original report has subsided, be assured the risk posed then is just as menacing now. <br />Alabama has made significant increases in its commitment to education in recent years with its overall education budget growing by approxi¬mately 50 percent between 2000 and 2006. Most of the state's current workers, however, did not have the opportunity to benefit from these investments. More than half a million Alabamians between the ages of 18 and 64 remain caught in the education gap, lacking a high school diploma or a GED. Ala¬bama's educational system has failed to equip these workers with the skills and certifications neces¬sary to compete in today's global economy. And for many other Alabamians, education ended with high school graduation; less than one-third of all adults between the ages of 25 and 54 have an associate's degree or higher.14 With the workplace becoming more complex, and employers demanding higher skill levels, many of these workers will be unable to compete in the job market without additional education and training. Until Alabama renews its commitment to education and training for adults, a basic education gap likely will persist for four decades or longer, until today's 25-year-olds retire. (Bridging the Gap, 2008, emphasis mine)<br /><br />It is again time to examine the progress of our public schools. However, it is past time for the public to demand accountability. Moreover, the Arise Citizens' Policy Project entitled, Bridging the Gap 2009, focuses on an unwieldy, PK-16 system and emphasizes remediation efforts to address underlying factors pressuring the dropout issue and the apparent discrepancy of public educations' inability to prepare students to succeed in a post secondary environment (Boser and Burd, 2009). <br />A critical examination of the education framework, process, and system associated with our children's future, its impact on our collective survival in a global economy, and the increasing frustration over moral, ethical, legal, academic issues that confound it continue to be a worthy topic for consideration. Whatever else ails American education, in general, and Alabama education, in particular, it should be understood from the outset that the existing educational framework comprised of the funding process and administrative system that it supports, is not broken - but rather designed to deliver mass-produce training to perform low-to-mid level skills. It simply has been inoculated with repeated doses of status quo; and as a consequence, has become totally resistant to real change other than faddish counterfeits posing as innovation. <br />Moreover, national, state, and local efforts continually aiming at improving education often are at cross-purposes over where to focus their reform-minded initiatives or precisely what must be done. What must be done cannot be done "on top of the existing" or "integrated into the present model." What must be done involves integration of content and facilities to inculcate values that emphasize and cherish character development, critical thinking, problem solving, team work, competitive-cooperation, and above all --- self-esteem. What can be done involves a personal commitment of the community's leadership to initiate the first steps in that direction: developing a prototype that moves us closer Towards a New American School.<br /><br />Statement of the Problem<br />At the state level, a legislative mechanism that serves primarily as a funding source legally appropriating the scarce dollars that are to be allocated for educating our children through a local school system. the funding process evolved into Some perceive the "system" as a reified institutional entity, i.e., the State Department of Education in Montgomery or the main office building where the superintendent works with other administrators and staff. Others might perceive the same system comprised of myriad individuals that daily care for students inside thousands of hallways, lunchrooms, band rooms, basketball courts, and classrooms across Alabama. Essentially, each perspective is value-laden and offers insight into the underlying principles relevant to the publics' perception of "actors in the ongoing drama."<br />The framework defines an alignment of the process and the system to direct a revenue stream from the public tax coffers to be dispersed according to legislatively binding spending measures, and then allocated to the recipients or local school authority (LEA). Since teaching is such a labor-intensive profession, approximately eighty percent (80%) to eighty-five (85%) of all funding goes towards employee wages and benefits with any remaining to fund the rest. It should be noted: Faculty have little direct input and absolutely no legal authority over the dispersal of funding. <br />Economic development in the 21st century begins with an entrepreneur seeking a readily available, high-skilled, adaptive, pool of human-resource capital. In fact, of the seven emerging roles of higher education's involvement in economic development described in a comprehensive review of the literature, human capital, broadly defined as targeted human-resource development (HRD), was the most important (Hethcox, 1990). The definition of Human Capital has been expressed in a variety of ways. Depending on who is the beneficiary, human capital might be expressed in terms of a commodity (emphasized as a cost of labor) or HRD as a capital investment in knowledge acquisition ie., providing employee opportunities to a seamless education. Decision makers must be willing to acknowledge commitment to capital investment in HRD with its purse, i.e., incentives offered for demonstrated evidence of best practices of instruction in an information-based global economy. Finally, the Wye Plantation Conference in Eastern Shore, MD, identified four major general resource development trends bearing on higher education: <br />1. the needs of students,<br />2. the delivery of information, <br />3. the organization of knowledge, and <br />4. the relationship of higher education to economic development.<br />The conference conclusion found that changing demographics meant academia must adjust to continuing, lifelong education of nontraditional students (Preer, 1984). Twenty-five years later, what significant adjustments have been made in teaching teachers or in student/faculty performance evaluations or in curricula innovations or in the manner in which knowledge is dispensed that seeks to accommodate those nontraditional students who increasingly choose to opt-out? Perhaps, the essential difference between the more successful as opposed to those who are not lies in the eyes of the beholder to determine whether education is perceived as an investment or as an expense.<br /><br />The Target in an Information Based Society:<br />Human Resource Development <br />Since WWII, successful universities' have distinguished themselves by an ability to adapt to an information-based global economy. Higher education, administrative, institutional cultures' ability to maintain flexibility was related directly to the way it perceives HRD:<br />1) With respect to what constitutes scholarly activity in light of increasing pedagogical demands on faculty;<br />2) With regard to format, location, and timing of instruction;<br />3) In response to external demands regarding new courses and curriculum; and <br />4) With regard to potential faculty collaboration with industry, government, and community needs.<br />The model of a modern university requires faculty to be in active contact with the world outside academia. If colleges and universities are to engage in economic development activities such as capacity building, technical assistance, technology transfer, human resource development, then faculty effort towards those ends must be rewarded. Although public service was the backbone of economic development at the local level, most faculty members believe that their public service activities were not rewarded. Furthermore, there were no mechanisms for measuring the amount of public service in higher education, no longitudinal studies of service activity, and no studies that linked reward systems and public service. Consequently, under the existing paradigm little institutional reward promotes faculty involvement in economic development activities.<br />In addition, few universities advocated rewarding faculty activity that: (a) created new knowledge, (b) trained others in their discipline or area of expertise, (c) interpreted aggregate-knowledge to make it more understandable and useful, and (d) disseminated knowledge to the appropriate audience. Under the present tenure and promotion system, faculty is rewarded for contributions to the research literature in professional journals. However, faculty are neither rewarded for synthesizing that literature in forms that might be useful to others, nor for providing policy analysis to industry, nor for developing applications of research to practical problems, nor for delivering technical assistance to either emerging or established industries, and especially not meaningfully rewarded for excellence in teaching. Outside of medicine and other hard sciences, this anachronistic university policy should have been challenged decades ago. <br />Another major aspect of human resource development that went beyond traditional postsecondary education and training activities and yet proved indicative of the need for higher education to adapt to the changing demographics of an adult student population was the issue of childcare (AASCU, 1986; Osborne, 1987).<br />Today, mothers of half of the children one year of age and under are at work. Most of these women need to and will stay at work. They and their families require good childcare. Only 1,800 of our six million employers provide such assistance in any form such as employee benefits, on-site care, or financing. (Choate cited in AASCU, 1986, p. 17) As a result of changing American lifestyles, more children were entering school from: "single-parent households; minority backgrounds; poverty households; teen-age mothers; Asian-American backgrounds with increasing language difficulties; and Hispanic backgrounds with a 40% high school drop out rate" (Hodgkinson, 1985, p. 10). <br /><br />The severity of social and economic consequences for failure to ameliorate eroding human resource losses has prompted states to examine ways to expand and improve childcare (Osborne, 1987). Reich (1988) estimated 20% of American 18-year-olds are functionally illiterate, and 25% drop out of high school before graduating and he acknowledged that this was not the sort of population likely to generate high productivity in the future (pp. 526-527). Postsecondary strategies of intervention were restricted by the nature of their mission, role, and scope; however, a viable community/technical college response might include offering workfare subsidized, on-campus day care facilities to students' children, and state and local subsidies to faculty, staff, and other students who qualify. <br />In addition, colleges of education could provide local pre-school programs a source for undergraduate practice teaching, graduate internships, and research grant opportunities to evaluate effective curricula and teaching methodologies, and to analyze early childhood learning behaviors: especially those related to disabilities and other aspects of rehabilitative special education. Thus, an approach to an institutional mission that fulfilled public service, teaching, and research responsibilities while addressing an urgent economic development and human resource need prompted this innovative response:<br />Provide a pre-school program for families of faculty, staff, and students.<br />The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES, 2000) compiles high school completion rates for the nation. These completion rates represent the proportion of 18- through 24-year-olds, not currently enrolled in high school or below, who have completed a high school diploma or an equivalent credential, including a General Educational Development (GED) credential. The data reveals that<br />  In 2000, 86.5 percent of all 18- through 24-year-olds not enrolled in high school had completed high school. Completion rates rose slightly from the early 1970s to the late 1980s, but have remained fairly constant during the 1990s; <br />  High school completion rates increased for White and Black young adults between the early 1970s and late 1980s, but have remained relatively constant in the 1990s; and<br />  By 2000, 91.8 percent of White and 83.7 percent of Black 18- through 24-year-olds had completed high school.<br />A more recent study builds upon a series of National Center for Education Statistics (NCES, 2005) reports on high school dropout and completion rates that began in 1988. It presents estimates of rates in 2005, provides data about trends in dropout and completion rates over the last three decades (1972-2005), and examines the characteristics of high school dropouts and high school completers in 2005. Four rates, "contributing unique information", purportedly presented to provide a broad picture of high school dropouts and completers in the United States; instead demonstrate what might be more aptly characterized as obfuscating the essential with the tangential.<br /><br />Again, NCES demonstrated that dropping out of high school is related to a number of negative outcomes. For example, the average income of persons ages 18 through 65 who had not completed high school was roughly $20,100 in 2005. By comparison, the average income of person's ages 18 through 65 who completed their education with a high school credential, including a General Educational Development (GED) certificate, was nearly $29,700. Dropouts are also less likely to be in the labor force than those with a high school credential or higher and are more likely to be unemployed if they are in the labor force. In terms of health, dropouts older than age 24 tend to report being in worse health than adults who are not dropouts, regardless of income (NCES, 2005). <br />Dropouts also make up disproportionately higher percentages of the nation's prison and death row inmates. Again, this is far from the sort of population likely to generate high productivity in the future (NCES, 2005). Postsecondary strategies of intervention have been restricted by the nature of their mission, roll, and scope; however, a viable community / technical college response might include offering workfare subsidized, on-campus day-care facilities to students' children, and state and local subsidies to faculty, staff, and other students who qualify. In addition, colleges of education PK programs could provide a source for undergraduate practice teaching, graduate internships, and research grant opportunities to evaluate effective curricula and teaching methodologies, and to analyze early childhood learning behaviors: especially those related to disabilities and other aspects of rehabilitative special education -- for example, the equestrian learning experience at the Alabama School for the Deaf and Blind (AIDB) in Talladega, Alabama.<br />A flexible response by academia to external demands regarding periodic reevaluation of new courses and curricula should be based on objective data that reflect the particular mission of the institution with respect to its role in human resource development. For example, the expansion of foreign trade in economic development has increased the role of postsecondary education in human resource development (Osborne, 1987). In particular, core instruction in international studies and promotion of foreign language requirements were cited most often as examples that effectively prepared students to cope with a global economy (AASCU, 1986; Choate & Linger, 1986; Doyle & Brisson, 1985; Levine, 1984; NEBHE, 1987). Although there were similar recommendations to strengthen the undergraduate core curriculum at the University of Maryland in 1981, it is even more appropriate in 2009 to advocate their inclusion in a senior high school curriculum in anticipation of college:<br />Promote a foreign language requirement.<br />Promote international studies that enhance knowledge of other cultures as a core requirement.<br />Conduct a year abroad foreign exchange program.<br />In the past, it was widely assumed that upon completion of a college education it was time to move on to the real world and to apply that knowledge; however, the increasingly rapid pace of technological change has made such a view totally unacceptable (WHSC, 1986, p. 27). For example, the half-life of an engineer's knowledge is thought to be three to five years (AASCU, 1986, p. 12) and implied the need for closer university-industry collaboration in continuing education with regard to curricula review and development. <br />Also, the current use of pedagogic methodologies is not conducive to adequate preparation of students for coping with problems in the face of rapid technological change (Choate & Linger, 1986; Levin, 1984; Li, 1980). For example, Kerr and Pipes argued that the crises in engineering education was a result of the emphasis placed on engineering science to develop basic knowledge at the expense of engineering design which entailed devising a system or process to meet desired needs (1987, pp. 37-38). Sample (1988) contended that being considered educated in America today demanded fluency in two languages--English and calculus. He concluded the concept of whole-person education, far from being a romantic notion was a necessity, "These times cry out for truly liberal and truly integrative education, both in the arts and sciences and in the undergraduate professional curricula" (Sample, 1988, p. 56). <br />Furthermore, Tucker (1983), in a paper presented at the National Conference on Higher Education entitled Reflections on Retooling America for Economic Growth through Investments in Higher Education, advocated educating nor just more engineers, but rather more engineers who are creative and broadly educated enough to tackle confidently quite unfamiliar problems. Tucker noted university efforts to respond to development of new fields of knowledge often cut across the old,<br />it adds interdisciplinary structures (institutes, laboratories, centers, and so on) that do not replace the old [departmental] structure, but are rather layered on above it. . . . But it is precisely in these interdisciplinary structures that students stand the best chance of working on large technical projects and on unconventional problems with a lot of colleagues in relatively flat organizational structures. Emphasis mine (1983, p. 5) <br />Consequently, if American engineering education intends to continue to be a vital part of economic growth through technological advancement, then curriculum changes to overcome lack of creativity and a practical sense of intervention to anticipate public needs are prerequisites for the engineering graduate of tomorrow. In this context, Parameter Analysis was born. <br />What is Parameter Analysis?<br />Professor Li, in Technological Innovation in Education and Industry, argued that while content knowledge may become obsolete, comprehension of innovation developed entrepreneurship. He advocated a methodology to instruct a population that found it difficult to verbalize - undergraduate engineering students. Li proposed a solution that sought to educate engineers through an interdisciplinary study approach and subsequent assessment through case study analysis. He described a classroom methodology that enhanced understanding of innovation and promoted entrepreneurship, called parameter analysis. Parameter analysis imitated the innovation process, i.e., a creative endeavor involving continual selection, analysis, evaluation, and synthesis:<br />Creative writing, music composition, dance, and athletics are taught in schools, even though achievement in each activity hinges heavily on individual talent. By contrast, in the conventional curriculum of engineering and management schools, very few courses emphasize developing creativity in invention and entrepreneurship. Emphasis Mine (Li, 1980, p. 23) <br />In addition to Parameter Analysis, methodology advocating interdepartmental cooperation that combined case studies with problem solving simulations. In order to promote problem solving, Li (1980) advocated multiple perspectives gained from multidisciplinary study and emphasized the importance of creativity in addition to content knowledge. His recommendations for enhancing student problem solving included:<br />Encourage undergraduate interdepartmental studies, and<br />Devise instructional methodologies across curricula that utilize multidisciplinary case studies in combination with problem solving simulations.<br />Other methodological strategies to promote understanding of the innovation process included conflict strategy models (Schelling, 1960), and multiple scenarios based on conceptual simulations (Allison, 1971). Advocates of conceptual models of a modern university insisted on the explicit recognition of the role of technology in science and industry and suggested the result of the separation of the two would be counter-productive for both (National Academy of Engineering Science, 1985). <br />Yet, in spite of the increased need for innovation, educational researchers who lack practical insight, continue to naively recommend a creative application of new perspective be layered on top of the existing framework, so that a finding "to encourage academic policy that requires multidisciplinary graduate study within the framework of traditional departments" (Hethcox, 1990) actually discounts the traditional university departments' propensity to adopt change with malice; and thus, stymie authentic efforts to stimulate lasting innovation. In spite of academia's efforts to stymie change in higher education administration policies, procedures and practices, occasionally evidence demonstrates that technological advances will erode such resistance if it can offer significant financial incentives to do so<br />Besides methodological changes in how we teach, new fields of study have emerged as a result of space exploration, advanced medical technology, and applications of computer science to other fields that have implications regarding what we teach. For example, the application of principles in computer science and management created a new field whose purpose was to manage and apply information systems (IS) technology. As a result IS has emerged as one of the most prolific management areas (AASCU, 1986). <br />Interestingly, unlike higher education, industry resistance to the status quo is counter balanced to some degree by competition, so that future entrepreneurial Davids can continue to overcome Goliaths. For example, in 1986 Microsoft went public and in combination with upstart Apple, eventually ended the era of mainframes and the domination of IBM. <br />In fact, the White House Science Council reported "the most exciting and fruitful research opportunities are to be found in the interface areas between the traditional disciplines" and encouraged federal funding to enhance multidisciplinary activities within the universities (Klingman & Phillips, 1988). (See Appendix 2 for a more full treatment of issues surrounding interdisciplinary studies in 2009). In addition to collaboration with industry and government, Lynton and Elman included community collaboration as well (1987, p. 110). Rolzinski defined community in terms of economic development that included "planning and implementing programs to improve the economic well-being of people within their social context" (1986, p. 90).<br /><br />As higher education institutions increase emphasis on economic development, the challenge of collaborative arrangements with business, organized labor, government, and community organizations presented unique problems considering the range of learner needs (Rolzinski, 1986, p. 93). She noted, at its most basic level, collaboration involved a single academic community working with a single business community, adult community, or labor community, and at its most advanced level, collaboration involved many organizational communities (1986, p. 93). The traditional roles of academia to collect and examine data and to explore ways of stating problems were valuable skills in helping community groups perceive how to develop the best possible strategies to mitigate large economic forces that affected them (Rolzinski, 1986, pp. 94-95). <br />In addition, the traditional human resource development role of academia made it an ideal capacity-building mechanism for helping community organizations define their own problems and find unique solutions (AASCU, 1986). Some institutions found that they could further contribute to community economic development efforts by encouraging collaboration of diverse groups through university-sponsored programs on a wide range of topics, such as advanced technology, exporting, new business development and raised these items of higher education human resource efforts aimed at community needs:<br />Establish advisory councils and other linkage mechanisms to keep in touch with community needs (AASCU, 1986, p. 48).<br />Build capacity through symposia and conferences involving diverse community groups including business, labor, and local government leaders and faculty to address economic development priorities (AASCU, 1986, p. 16).<br />Educate policy makers and the general public about university resources that could promote local economic development (Doyle & Brisson, 1985, p. 18).<br />Why are administrators slow to act, if in fact for decades, the White House Science Council has encouraged federal funding to enhance multidisciplinary activity within the university? Research indicates that behemoth institutions, i.e., the church, government, public schools, etc. are historically slow to act to make any change. Consequently, a key principle inherent in many vast, bureaucratic, institution's inability to influence meaningful policy directives (such as those involved in a state's education appropriation or course transfer processes) is typically characterized by fierce, well-organized, resistance to any change that would disrupt the status quo. What is their underlying concern? <br />Some have argued that such is the nature of a bureaucratic, plantation mentality; some claim inept administrators or powerful teacher unions are to blame; while still others blame either a left-or-right wing conspiracy depending on their personal political bias. More than likely, it is a combination of factors that may or may not include all the above. Application of Occam's razor infers the answer is simply that no genuine impetus exists within the organization for systemic change. Perhaps, the more astute administrator perceives any pronounced deviance from the status quo is an unnecessarily foolish risk to career advancement already fraught with considerable unknowns. Thus, incentives should be implemented that would make it worth the career risks for administrators to propose innovation and for faculty (and all other significant stakeholders) to accept responsibility for its execution.<br />As higher education institutions increase emphasis on economic development, the challenge of collaborative agreements with business, organized labor, government, and community organizations presented unique problems considering the range of learner needs. In addition to collaboration with industry and government, community collaboration should also be included. At its most basic level, collaboration involved a single academic community working with a single business community, adult community, or labor community, and at its most advanced level, collaboration involved many organizational communities. In terms of economic development, community collaboration included planning and implementing programs to improve the economic well being of people within their social context. <br />The traditional roles in academia to collect and examine data and to explore ways of stating problems were valuable skills in helping community groups perceive how to develop the best possible strategies to mitigate large economic forces that affected them. In addition, the traditional human resource development role in academia made it an ideal capacity building mechanism for helping community organizations define their own problems and find unique solutions. Some postsecondary institutions found that they could further contribute to community economic development efforts by encouraging collaboration of diverse groups through University-sponsored programs on a wide range of topics, such as: practical application of advanced technology in nurturing new business development, i.e., exporting. These efforts should include the most appropriate methodologies as well as the most efficient delivery systems to transfer that knowledge to intended end-users. <br /><br />New American School<br />I propose a New American School. It would be a hybrid based on an expansion of the post-WW I Bauhaus concept and Lockheed's Skunk Works research & design model. The primary mission of a New American School is do no harm to those entrusted to our care for cognitive development. The goal of a New American School is creation of an environment that fosters innovation and promotes the unique characteristic-set pertinent to human inspiration; and especially, the quality of earned respect which is vital to development of authentic self-esteem. Upon these two uniquely, genuine human responses - inspiration and self esteem, success of such a program relies. In order to accomplish these goals a New American School seeks to integrate the concept of form follows function by recognition of the influence that physical facilities have on the social interactive environment and its subsequent impact on human resource development. The singular initiative of a New American School is the promotion, growth, and development of a new kind of engineer - an Imagineer or one who is skilled in the process innovation pipeline completion cycle. A process innovation pipeline completion cycle requires a collaborative group action similar to the Manhattan Project that involves marshaling all forces necessary in 1) performing basic research from conception to dispersal of findings, and 2) using applied research skills in order to convert basic research findings into a concept that provides a product or service useful to a niche market. (See Appendices 7 & 8 for a more full treatment of the subject)<br />Conclusion<br />Several aspects of the increased importance of the critical role of higher education and PK-14 in human resource development have been noted. Innovation that encouraged change was the major theme in the literature underlying the PK-14 and higher education partnership where the most successful engagements of economic development occurred at the regional, state, and local levels. Change that reflected the small, incremental steps in perception that are essential, in the early stages of the innovation process as the prevailing paradigm shifts to another. Interestingly, the predominant source of change initially was rarely due to any professional organization or trade association; but rather by a single advocate who painstakingly nurtured enduring change, i.e., a change agent or a champion. Change of that type fosters economic development and includes the following:<br /> Changes in administrative attitudes toward faculty;<br /> Changes in administrative perspectives of student needs with regard to format, to location, and to timing of instruction; and<br /> Changes in the organization of knowledge.<br />As with most behemoth social institutions, except for cosmetic changes, real change is relatively rare. It can be argued that administrators, at all levels, are slow to become an agent of change because there is a negative incentive to do so, i.e., charting new directions into the unknown as opposed to maintaining the status quo is rationally perceived as an unnecessary risk to career advancement. Consequently, if there is no impetus from within the organization for systemic change, then by necessity, pressure from outside the traditional avenues should and must make those demands on behalf of those beneficiaries whose trust fund has been violated. <br />In other words, real change means a charting a new course utilizing meaningful reports based on accurate, reliable data; rather than on, vendettas, ego-driven turf battles, and stale political agendas. It means focusing on the issues that stretch out directly in front of us rather than facing backwards walking into the future because "that's the way things always have been done." Attempting to apply lipstick to a pig-snout is not only counterproductive; it delays what posterity demands - - the social, economic, and political courage to implement genuine change regarding the manner in which this nation conducts the enterprise of teaching the adults of tomorrow. Consequently, all involved in rebuilding a 21st century educational framework must possess the intellectual integrity to be able to acknowledge the substantial difference between cosmetic changes merely for the sake of appearance as opposed to authentic innovation. The former rightly complain of the exorbitant expense while the latter willingly acknowledge the wise investment. <br />References<br /><br />Allison, G. (1971).

3279-4049	Evoke the Wisdom of Crowds by Co-Creating Compelling Alternative Visions of the Future	2009-05-26 00:00:00	While dialog and deliberation techniques (America Speaks, Deliberative Juries, Open Space, World Café, etc) all have important roles to play in increasing public participation, their proponents may benefit from considering some additional working assumptions and principles.<br /><br />Crowd wisdom principles<br /><br />1. The wisdom of crowds is best evoked when we get beyond the pros and cons of any single policy alternative and consider the complex systems within which any policy must co-exist.<br />2. The wisdom of crowds is energized when the future is the canvas for co-creative thinking. <br />3. The wisdom of crowds is best channeled by combining rich objective data with informal and imaginative processes. <br />4. The wisdom of crowds is best expressed in stories about tomorrow, sometimes called scenarios. <br />5. The wisdom of crowds can be tapped through voting, but only after concrete and divergent visions have been expressed.<br />6. The wisdom of crowds provides the best lens for identifying truly alternative and actionable options.<br /><br />Working Assumptions<br /><br />1. Learning how complex the world is can be hard work. The general population is quite capable of learning to think systematically if they are supported by safe, information rich, informal processes that incorporate indirect learning as a side effect of engaging activities. <br />2. Stories are a key to both cognitive and emotional engagement. For most people, the ability to hold complex ideas in memory depends on whether those ideas are woven into a narrative that is compelling; one that is driven by recognizable characters and that has an internal logic and consistency. <br />3. Voting on a partial or incomplete story can be a helpful precursor to voting a policy alternative up or down. For example, participants can be asked "Do you think a particular event could happen, would it matter if it did, and under which version of the future is this event more likely to happen?" Answers to these questions spark discussion of possibilities without closing off alternatives. <br />4. Stories can be finer grained and more nuanced than policies. At the same time, they are 'just stories.' They don't carry the weight and political consequences of a policy vote. <br /><br /><br />Who writes and edits public participation stories or scenarios?<br /><br />Scenarios are compelling stories about alternative futures. Effective scenarios animate a large number of facts and considerations. Few members of the general public have the desire, interest, or skills necessary to write compelling scenarios from scratch. But most people directly affected by a policy have the desire, interest and skills necessary to discuss, learn from, and accept or edit elements of scenarios that are offered for their consideration.<br /><br />Facilitator/authors can start the scenario process, creating initial stories from research and interviews and guiding participants through review and editing activities. Participants in an interactive scenario workshop analyze stories, add their own responses to questions, and develop a larger narrative that explains how the initial story could happen, the forces that would have to line up to help or hinder it, and the actions that would have to be taken between now and a future date to make the scenario happen.<br /><br />The scenarios matter, but they are primarily a springboard. The real payoffs are the creative policy recommendations and the citizen empowerment that results.<br /><br />Where have scenarios fostered public engagement and empowerment?<br /><br />Scenario-based public engagement of has worked well in critical situations, most notably in South Africa at the end of apartheid <br />(http://gcp.aspen.grida.no/training/manual/module6.aspx). Diverse groups of stakeholders were engaged by encountering sharply different stories about the possible future of their country. The stories were not 'top down' predictions, they were invitations to have a structured exploration of what could happen, to learn how the complex elements of society interact, and to discover what could be done to encourage the best possibilities. <br /><br />Calling this approach scenario planning understates its power. Peer-learning and community-building are important parts of its legacy. The citizen planners themselves come to share knowledge, skills, perspective and purpose. Graduates of a scenario deliberation workshop form a critical mass of scenario-fluent thinkers who can become valuable pro-active teachers and facilitators in their communities.<br /><br />Closer to home, my colleagues and I have helped engage stakeholders in scenario projects by writing short newspaper stories that describe events that could happen by various dates in the future if present trends continue or if alternative policies are adopted. We do not ask people to accept our stories as true; we invite them to make that determination themselves in consultation with their peers. We also ask them to "finish" the stories since they are deliberately incomplete. Participants are asked to be reporters from the future, reflecting back creatively on their vision of what is possible between now and a future date. We ask them 'report' on how alternative policies and programs worked or didn't, who was helped or hurt, and how opposing positions and the concerns of the most vulnerable were met. <br /><br />Participants begin their engagement by choosing which future news stories come closest to their initial vision of the future. Their choices tend to provoke productive learning conversations as other participants seek to understand the reasons behind each other's opinions. Unlike fixed beliefs that are grounded in the in the past, no one knows for sure what will happen in the future. A brief review of recent events is usually sufficient to gain agreement that no one's personal predictions should take precedence. So the uncertainty and risk inherent in the future actually opens up the discussion. As facilitators, we compare responses and votes on news stories from different teams advocating or defending different future policies and feed this back to the participants so that it becomes an input to their overall deliberation. <br /><br />Voting to discern before voting to decide<br /><br />Citizens get to "try out" a version of their ideas or preferences and see how they compare and play out before getting caught up in the high-stakes debate. New and old ideas combine. Implications are uncovered and their validity tested. Voting about hypothetical futures and finding out how your opinions compare with others is engaging enough to motivate learning. At the same time, it is less contentious than a "final" vote or even a ranking vote on a list of issues or questions. None of the alternative future stories is taken as 'given.' Each is examined and then put aside to become a possible ingredient in a later new or modified scenario. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Our future is too important to be left to experts or to be controlled by well intentioned but under-informed advocates who haven't grasped the complexity and richness of the systems in which we must live or the diversity of those who have the right to influence public policy. Interactive Scenario Planning doesn't completely level the playing field, but it can narrow the knowledge gap between the most and least informed so that the voices and contributions of all can be heard and the true wisdom of the crowd can emerge.</div><br />	scenarioguy	49	54	5	8	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3279-4049	
3280-4049	Add "www.whitehouse.gov" to the podium in the White House for TV viewers	2009-05-26 00:00:00	The idea: If the text "www.whitehouse.gov" would be visible on the podium in front of the microphones on all occasions when the President speaks, more and more of those folks would visit the powerful website of the white house whom would have never thought of doing so before.<br /><br />Every time President Obama speaks, millions of people watch him (not always the same millions).<br /><br />The TV is the best advertising venue, why not "utilize" it any time the President speaks from the White House? (Or even from the library of Congress if it's OK by any means).<br /><br />Why is this idea important?<br /><br />Because, the website of the White House can be and is so powerful in communicating with the American people (First time in History!!!).<br /><br />I think, it would be even better if President Obama would take the opportunity once and mention the website of the White House in one of his speeches, talk about the different ways the American people can communicate with the White House and actively participate in building the future.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	geza	44	47	3	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3280-4049

They could write resolutions, to send to their state senators, and even their U.S. Congress people. <br /><br />They could make their own flags and seals, write their own neighborhood anthems, and even hold their own elections. Perhaps they could even elect a representative to represent them at city and school board meetings.<br />they might even have sponsered meetings, to learn from other cities, getting to know other points of view. Maybe they could even find sponsership for wider broader meetings. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Teenagers are citizens of this country too, and they are usually more intuned with the social problems of thier environment.

3284-4049	Fire or demote military spokespeople who lie	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Throughout the Bush-Cheney wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and now in Obama's Af-Pak War, US military spokespeople have made hundreds of public statements that later turned out to be false and/or unsupported by accurate information from the field. This has brought back the Credibility Gap that the mass media noticed during the Vietnam War. After each bombing of civilians in a village or town, the military should either admit that our troops committed an atrocity or say they don't have enough information to make a public statement yet. If they make a statement that turns out to be false, they should be fired or demoted. These false statements are damaging the credibility of our nation and contributing to our defeat in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Counterinsurgency wars are known as "fourth-generation warfare."

3289-4049	The United States of America Citizens Leadership Inside The Parameters Of The Present Obama Administration.	2009-05-26 00:00:00	The United States of America Citizens Section of Terminological Inexactitude.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The Obama Administration made an acceptable shake of brains into the United States of America and gathered for curiosity the most notable scientists. I have been using all Media for my job,and many times I've found scientists who are not working as volunteers for the Obama Team but from their stages on Psychology,Physics etc have been giving their scientific opinions about what they think the Obama Administration should do. Among these pieces of advice one of the most notables for me is given by a Psychologist in Teenagers Education.He expressed clearly on the Internet: "The Obama Administration is good enough to be able to change the United States quality or standard in American Education,and policies for this particular purpose are fairly good,but not very good if the Obama Administration forgets the competent advice from a high qualified team of Psychologists who must provide adequate training and technics to all school educators who through evaluations turn up all pieces of work and performance done into schools,into Education boards and institutions.Without this advice the Obama Administration could not go so far and not succeed in reaching the necessary standard,especially in the difficult job of educating modern children and teens." I believe this,too.And we all scientists saw the opportunity we all were waited and gave up since we found how the Public Administration frame(s) are not able to move flexibly in its own developed way,without the tremendous pressure that it gets from the Vatican,Christian,Catholic churches,groups,and from Israel.Then we all scientists had to step back,give our Vote to the Obama Administration waiting again for the best performance and results to see the Americans working,creating new jobs after they found reasonable decisions to close other jobs which now we found have been destroying the layer of gases that for millions of years the planet Earth had as a roof avoiding cancer and the worst human diseases-but from now to increase.Close jobs that destroy the planet is also part of the religious barrier that destroys scientific opinions,educators advice,and all the best knowledgements. Now,the Obama Administration has many times invited us to talk,to advise,to create new policies instead of keeping us waiting for the change we need,for the change that could help the United States of America and other countries that make all the important decisions about jobs,taxes,laws,international relationships,etc. Our minds are working for this purpose but when we look around we see that we all scientists are not the authority to make any change in any sector or section,or town,or in a community because Christian,Catholic groups and the Vatican administration refused to take actions showing the world that God is not a leader,that priests are not spiritual advisors especially in politics,jobs,financial and human rights affairs since their education has come from the Bible and Jerusalem ancient policies. Even Mr Barack Obama had to initiate his political career helping the poor into a church because they wer gathered not knowing where to go for help and spiritual advice,Mr Obama realized he is not only a politician but also a great spiritual leader able to make the United States of America feeling Happy and Free at a time when happiness and freedom are farther than years ago,in a time of bloody government left by the Bush'es Administration managed to lead thousands of thousands of mental and physical disabled approved by the Bushes government that disabled the world wide economy humilliating school students,teachers,researchers,scientists,pure art and artists,and all science results until today.<br /><br />My idea is the creation of the United States of America Citizens Section of Terminological Inexactitude in order to give protection to all the people who had never gotten any opportunity to show up on the social stages; to support all subjects and research at all the United States schools; to hold up all the schools' teachers work and researchers' results; to give the exact level to each and every American Citizen into all the United States communities,local groups,towns and cities at which everybody works,suffers,cries,needs, succeeds,fails,asks for. The Terminological Inexactitude Section will receive all the visits,e-mails,letters or notes from all the American Citizens who have been cheated,victims of made-up stories economically with the truth into all the schools,boards of education,official buildings. The Obama Public Administration has to fit its political system congruently with its economic,militar,spiritual,social realities,and stop the fabrication of lies,stories inventing fictional happiness or systems that still support a bloody Christ gathering money from the bottom to the top.It is important to stop prostitution and political corruption,stop the porno and strip teasers into the government and offices. Let's create the adequate section to use and give the right words to each and every American citizen. This new section has to receive a written promise from all the paramedical staff and police forces to set a national agreement to limit violence and control it.This section could be considered as a part of the Judicial authorities,too,or the Education top authority.</div><br />	hispickup.andtractor	-9	2	11	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3289-4049

3295-4049	Harnessing the Power of the Crowd	2009-05-26 00:00:00	The concept of "crowd-sourced accountability" -- opening up data for the public to analyze and serve as the government's eyes and ears to spot potential misuse of government funds -- offers intriguing possibilities. <br /><br />But it also raises an important question for government officials, spanning the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, the Government Accountability Office, federal agencies, states, and localities: How can the government manage a potential avalanche of input, sort through millions of comments and allegations, focus scarce resources for maximum impact, and safeguard citizens from potential harassment and false accusations? <br /><br />One answer - both for speed and effectiveness - is to tap into existing models that federal agencies are using to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. <br /><br />For example, the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) program run by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) focuses on detecting and correcting improper payments in the Medicare fee-for-service program. Congress legislated a demonstration RAC program under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. According to the CMS Recovery Audit Contractor Website (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/RAC/), "The RAC demonstration program has proven to be successful in returning dollars to the Medicare Trust Funds and identifying monies that need to be returned to providers. It has provided CMS with a new mechanism for detecting improper payments made in the past, and has also given CMS a valuable new tool for preventing future payments." Based on this success, CMS is rolling out the program in states across the country this year. <br /><br />One important factor in the CMS program's success has been applying technology to help auditors and investigators sort through large volumes of data to spot areas of fraud, waste, and abuse and trigger investigative action. This use of technology maps ties well to an idea request posted by the RATB during the recent National Dialogue on Recovery Act information technology solutions -- at http://www.thenationaldialogue.org/ideas/hotline-and-case-referral-solutions -- asking for hotline and case referral solutions. Additional related ideas were also posted to the Recovery Act National Dialogue at http://www.thenationaldialogue.org/ideas/protecting-stimulus-funds-from-fraud-waste-and-abuse. <br /><br />More on this idea is posted at http://www.collaborativegov.org/MyBlog/recovery-act-accountability-harnessing-the-power-of-the-crowd.html <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Helps provide a path to make practical use of potentially large volumes of data coming in from interested citizens participating in government by reporting potential instances of fraud, waste and abuse. </div><br />	andrew.mclauchlin	-1	5	6	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3295-4049	
3296-4049	Win/Win with China	2009-05-26 00:00:00	The U.S. has got a hell of a mess to clean up, with the failure of major banks and investment firms that have had a negative impact on the global economy and hurt people everywhere -- and that was from a failure to regulate due to corruption in the government, which still has not been acknowledged or addressed.<br /><br />There is no moral standing whatsoever at this point to police other countries or to tell any other country what they need to improve on, no, not when the U.S. has been fighting aggressive wars for profit and torturing prisoners, allowing war criminals and profiteers to operate unchecked and scam artists to run the major financial centers.<br /><br />So it makes all the sense in the world to befriend China and not diss it... and especially not go about provoking it militarily. It's crazy, is what it is. And what's this about passing a military budget of 91 billion dollars to prepare to fight on multiple fronts? It's the biggest military buildup the world has ever seen and it sends a very clear message to China and other countries that the U.S. has every intention of fighting for what it wants.<br /><br />How do you get an entire country to snap out of its' mass psychosis of megalomania? What does it take for average Americans to see that we do not want to go down the path of Armegeddon. It's old thinking. It isn't necessary. It really isn't necessary. If the U.S. were to disarm and start being rational about what can be done to turn things around, other countries would no longer engage in this massive military build-up that can only lead to global war and more suffering and misery... is that really what people want?<br /><br />I mean, get real. We've got all this great technology and breakthroughs today. Everyone could be prospering. Yeah, everyone. It's possible. Just get out of this mindset that you've gotta be stronger than everyone else. Can we just respect each other as equals? The sooner Americans get it that we're not superior to anyone else and we don't deserve any more than anyone else, and learn to share, then we can start to have win/win relations with China and just about everybody else, too.

3299-4049	Develop and Implement a National Strategy for Sustainability	2009-05-26 00:00:00	I would suggest that the best way to strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness, while making government more transparent, participatory, and collaborative, would be for the Obama Administration to lead the American People in Developing and Implementing a National Strategy for Sustainability. <br /><br />It is commonly recognized that those of us in the United States are not living sustainably today. With only 5% of the world's population, we consume 1/4 of the natural resources. Since 1940, Americans alone have used more of the earth's mineral resources than all previous humans put together. We still only recycle about 15% of our waste; use 120 pounds of natural resources per person per day; and greenhouse gas emissions rose 13 percent in the US between 1990 and 2003 according to the EPA's 2007 Report on the Environment. Meanwhile humanity uses 30% more of the earth's bio-capacity than can be sustained. At this rate, we'll need two planets to live on to meet everyone's needs by 2030.<br /><br />Fortunately, millions of Americans are already doing what we can to change the situation and to contribute to creating a more sustainable future. Now our federal government needs to lead the people in creating a Sustainable America.<br /><br />GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT<br /><br />The US agreed to create a National Strategy for Sustainability during the UN Rio Earth Summit Conference in 1992 and then again at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. The US is one of the few Developed Countries that has not already developed, much less implemented, a National Strategy Plan. The Obama Administration should thus invite all Americans to join it in developing and implementing our National Strategy for Sustainability, beginning with a review of the reports and recommendations from the President's Council on Sustainable Development that were developed during the Clinton years. See: See: http://clinton5.nara.gov/PCSD<br /><br />The National Strategy could encourage such things as green building practices; transitioning to renewable energy; protecting and restoring the natural environment; limiting toxic chemicals; investing in all types of green jobs; adopting sustainable business practices; educating for sustainable development; ensuring that all people's basic human needs can be met; and integrating the work of artists, engineers, educators, and restoration scientists on infrastructure, restoration, and other sustainable community projects; etc. <br /><br />(This recommendation and description of the National Strategy for Sustainability is rather long as it is meant to introduce the idea to key people within the Obama Administration. If you want to know more about it please continue reading, however if not but you still like the idea please vote for it now.)<br /><br />There is already a lot of interest and support for this idea of creating a National Strategy for Sustainability. In December I entered a proposal urging the Obama Administration to develop and implement a National Strategy for Sustainability in Change.org's Ideas for Change in America web voting competition. It made it in the Top Ten out of more than 7800 Ideas entered and 600,000 votes cast and was in first place within the category of Environmental Conservation. <br /><br />GOALS, GUIDELINES, AND PRINCIPLES<br /><br />The development of a National Strategy for Sustainability ought to be based upon an agreed set of guidelines and principles, such as those developed by the OECD, beginning with a participatory and collaborative process (see: http://www.oecd.org/DATAOECD/34/10/2669958.PDF page 73). Coordinated and cooperative action is needed and the federal government needs to lead the way. The Strategy should include an Action Plan, authorizing legislation, and a significant budget and appropriations. An Office of Sustainability ought to be established, along with inter-agency working group(s) and a cabinet level committee on sustainability. Each state could be required to issue an annual report on sustainability. <br /><br />The overall goal of the National Strategy for Sustainability ought to be to make as rapid a transition to full sustainability as is feasibly possible. A system of metrics and indicators is needed along with a Visioning and Planning Process which encourages the participation of the American People in determining our common future. In fact, the Administration ought to support civil society in playing a leading role in developing an independent multi-stakeholder process that fully involves all serious and committed contributors in driving the development of the National Strategy for Sustainability. <br /><br />The National Academy of Public Administration and the National Academy of Sciences are two Congressionally chartered, non-profit, non-partisan institutions that provide an example of the type of entity that could be established with the mandate to lead the process of developing and implementing a National Strategy, which would include but also go well beyond government participation and activities. <br /><br />GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION<br /><br />At the global level, preparations and consultations have already begun again at the United Nations for the 20th Anniversary of the Earth Summit Conference which will most likely be held again in Brazil in 2012. The US is going to look pretty foolish if we are one of the only developed countries that is not yet implementing a Sustainability Strategy and Plan. In addition, the federal government ought to be developing a process to encourage multi-stakeholder input and participation in the preparatory process for the Summit; and the effort to create a US Strategy could provide a good means for doing so. <br /><br />The United Nations is also completing a ten year Marrakech Process to develop a Global Framework of Action on Sustainable Consumption and Production; and our federal government has just begun to participate actively in this process within the last year or two, though it did host a North American consultation in Washington DC in November of 2008. (http://esa.un.org/marrakechprocess) The Obama Administration should thus integrate the development of a National Framework on Sustainable Consumption and Production with our National Strategy for Sustainability and ensure that both are integrated as well with the Global Framework. <br /><br />EDUCATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT<br /><br />We are also now half way through the UN Decade on Education for Sustainable Development and UNESCO recently held it's five year review conference for the Decade in Bonn (http://www.desd.org). In the US the US Partnership for Education on Sustainable Development has been leading the organizing effort (www.uspartnership.org); but unfortunately the federal government has provided very little leadership to date in engaging our country in this global process. <br /><br />The US Partnership developed a series of recommendations, in partnership with the Working Group for Sustainable Change, which we submitted to the Obama Administration and Transition Teams for how the US could strengthen its involvement and promote Education for Sustainable Development. These recommendations should be considered both by the Department of Education and as we work on developing and implementing both the National Strategy and the Ten Year Framework on Sustainable Consumption and Production. (see: http://change.gov/open_government/entry/us_partnership_on_education_for_sustainable_development/)<br /><br />STRENGTHENING AND RENEWING PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVES<br /><br />During the run up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 several hundred UN Partnership Initiatives were also developed. Both the Bush and Obama Administrations have taken quite an interest in many of these Partnership Initiatives. They provide an excellent means for implementing sustainability programs and policies both in the US and around the world. Unfortunately, most of them remain rather under-capitalized and need much more funding to be able to fulfill the great promise and urgent role that they could provide. As a part of the development of the National Strategy for Sustainability the federal government should thus review these Partnership Initiatives and determine what could be done in the US and by our government to strengthen them; and the US citizenry should be invited to participate actively in this review process as well. (See: http://www.usda.gov/oce/sustainable/partnerships.htm and http://www.sdp.gov/usgweb.) <br /><br />The STAR Community Index is a new framework for improving the livability and sustainability of U.S. communities. ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability USA, the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and the Center for American Progress (CAP) have established a partnership to develop STAR with the goal of launching this tool in January 2010. (see: http://www.iclei-usa.org/programs/sustainability/star-community-index) The STAR website states that, "there is a pressing need for a national framework to guide sustainable community initiatives. Many local governments have already developed frameworks, while others are seeking a framework that can be adapted to reflect local conditions. These frameworks offer a vast diversity in the structure and focus making it very difficult to compare the progress of one locality to another and reducing the opportunity to leverage change and share lessons learned." <br /><br />A similar situation exists but the need is perhaps even more pronounced within the business community, educational institutions, and particularly within and among state governments. The development of a National Strategy should thus incorporate and promote the development of the STAR Community Index and support the development of similar such initiatives for businesses, educational institutions, rural communities, and state governments. <br /> <br />THE PRESIDENT'S MEMORANDUM ON TRANSPARENCY AND OPEN GOVERNMENT<br /><br />As one of his first acts in office President Obama issued a Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government in which he outlined three principles for his administration: transparency, participation, and collaboration. The Memorandum states that, "Collaboration actively engages Americans in the work of their Government. Executive departments and agencies should use innovative tools, methods, and systems to cooperate among themselves, across all levels of Government, and with nonprofit organizations, businesses, and individuals in the private sector." <br /><br />There could probably be no better way to engage the American people in the work of our government, at all levels, than to develop and begin to implement a National Strategy for Sustainability. Non-profit organizations, businesses, individuals, educators, and government employees at all levels are already doing what they can to contribute to creating a sustainable future; and we would welcome the opportunity, if provided by the federal government, to provide our expertise on how our country can do so as well. <br /><br />SHARING THE EXPERTISE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH GOVERNMENT<br /><br />The Memorandum goes on to state that, "Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. Executive departments and agencies should offer Americans increased opportunities to participate in policymaking and to provide their Government with the benefits of their collective expertise and information." Again, the development of a National Strategy and a Ten Year Framework on Sustainable Consumption and Production would provide an excellent vehicle to enable the American people to share our collective expertise and information with government departments and agencies. <br /><br />This would now include a multitude of initiatives that have been developed or are now springing up such as: the ABA's Model Sustainability Policy and Implementation Guidelines for Law Organizations, the Environmental Law Institute, the US Green Building Council's LEED Program, National Ski Areas Association's Sustainable Slopes Environmental Charter, California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance, AIGA Center for Sustainable Design, Green-Blue Institute's Design Competitions, various Standards and Certification Schemes, and a great number of business consultants specializing in sustainable development. <br /><br />Then there is the PlugIn Hybrid Electric Vehicle Partnership, ICLEI's Star Community Index, SustainLane's Sustainable Development knowledge base for State and Local Government officials, Sustainable Land Development International, the Bioneers, BioMimicry Guild, Zero Waste Alliance, Center for a New American Dream, Lowell Center for Sustainable Production, North American Sustainable Consumption Alliance, US Citizens Network for Sustainable Development, Sustainable Communities Network, etc. These are just a few examples of the many people and initiatives, showing just a bit of the breadth of the movement, that would eagerly embrace the opportunity to share their knowledge and information with government at all levels. <br /><br />OVERCOMING POLICY IMPEDIMENTS AND EMBRACING COLLABORATION<br /><br />Now I would like to respond to two questions raised as a part of this Open Government Dialogue process. We've been asked, "What policy impediments to innovation in government currently exist?"<br /><br />There is currently a lack of coordination of activities within and among agencies at all levels of government; lack of a coordinated approach toward dealing effectively with a host of urgent problems that must be solved to create a more sustainable future; coordinated means by which all stakeholders can contribute effectively to providing common solutions that could be replicated throughout our society; etc. These problems could all be solved through an effect effort to develop and implement a National Strategy for Sustainability. <br /><br />"What is the best way to change the culture of government to embrace collaboration?"<br /><br />The Obama Administration could develop an open and participatory process welcoming all Americans to join in developing and implementing a National Strategy for Sustainability, including such stakeholders as municipal and state government, the business community, educational leaders and students, civil society, etc. The effectiveness of such partnership processes has been demonstrated time and again through collaborations such as the US Partnership on Education for Sustainable Development, the National Council on Science and the Environment, the President's Council on Sustainable Development, the National Academy of Sciences Board on Sustainable Development/Report, the National Summit on Sustainable Development, UN Commission on Sustainable Development processes, UN Partnership Initiatives for Sustainable Development, etc. <br /><br />ACHIEVING A SUSTAINABLE AMERICA<br /><br />Finally, Law Professor John Dernbach's latest book, Agenda for a Sustainable America starts with a simple but powerful premise: "Sustainable development would make the United States more livable, healthy, secure, and prosperous. Policies that promote sustainability would reduce risks to our national security, improve our economic efficiency and productivity, enhance our health and communities, improve the lives of the poorest among us, and foster greater human wellbeing in other countries. And it would achieve these things while protecting and restoring the environment for our generation and for generations that follow."<br /><br />Now those are goals that would be worth striving for as we develop and begin to implement our National Strategy for Sustainability. <br /><br />For more information please contact:<br /><br />Rob Wheeler<br />Campaign for a Sustainable America<br />Robineagle @ worldcitizen.org<br />Robwheeler22 @ gmail.com<br />717-264-5036<br /><br />Citizens Network for Sustainable Development<br />www.citnet.org<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Rob  Wheeler	87	98	11	7	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3299-4049

3305-4049	Extend successful government data exchange models to improve federal-state-local data sharing	2009-05-26 00:00:00	A key factor to enabling collaboration across federal, state and local governments -- and enabling reuse of associated regulatory and spending data to improve government operations -- is to get accurate and timely reports from the field in a format that is highly reusable on the web. This is a massive challenge, with tens of thousands of state and local government entities alone among the universe of potential organizations required to report regulatory or spending activity to the federal government.<br /><br />The good news is that the federal government has tackled such reporting situations before -- in partnership with state and local governments -- and can adapt successful models to enable efficient and effective data collection and dissemination.<br /><br />The federal government could build upon the successes of existing federal information exchange programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's Central Data Exchange (CDX). The idea is to adapt free open source data exchange tools that the government already uses for other mission purposes to aggregate and publish the regulatory and spending data across multiple missions. <br /><br />For example, EPA's CDX (http://xml.coverpages.org/epa-cdx.html) applies this approach with the help of open source gateway technology that helps states report data required by environmental regulations. This approach can be adjusted at relatively low cost to help collect and disseminate information on programs that span federal, state and local jurisdictions. <br /><br />For additional information this idea in correlation to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, see the following:<br /><br />National Dialogue on the Recovery Act: http://www.thenationaldialogue.org/ideas/adapt-successful-federal-data-exchange-programs-to-arra-recipient-reporting <br /><br />Tackling Recovery Act Transparency: http://collaborativegov.org/MyBlog/tackling-transparency.html <br /><br />Coverage from the DorobekInsider.com <br />http://federalnewsradio.com/?nid=150&sid;=1651108 <br /><br />Cracking the Tough Nut of Recovery Act Reporting<br />http://www.collaborativegov.org/MyBlog/recovery-act-reporting.html <br /><br />www.collaborativegov.org<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>1. The fact that this approach is open source means it's available to federal agencies, states and local governments to reuse to report and aggregate data from both very old and more modern systems. <br /><br /><br /><br />2. This model enables efficient reporting of accurate regulatory and spending data for reuse by government organizations and the public. <br /><br /><br /><br />3. It provides the ability to capture valuable data in a format that can be reused many ways for better decision-making -- both by citizens and government. <br /><br /> <br /><br />4. It has high potential for reuse by states to help manage reporting challenges of collecting data from localities <br /><br /><br /><br />5. It offers flexibility to change over time, as the programs and success measures evolve.<br /><br /></div><br />	andrew.mclauchlin	11	13	2	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3305-4049

3310-4049	COPYRIGHT IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INFORMATION	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Mandate use of notices and metadata to distinguish U.S. Government works from copyrighted works disseminated by the federal government.<br /><br />U.S. GOVERNMENT WORKS <br />Under law, the burden of copyright compliance is on users. Knowing what isn't copyrighted is as important as knowing what is in our digital networked mashed-up world. U.S. Government Works authored by federal government employees or officers on the job as part of their official duties are by law specifically excluded from copyright protection in the U.S. immediately at the time of creation and fixation (Title 17 USC, Sec 101 and Sec 105).<br /><br />In April 2009, the White House led the way by identifying its photographs on Flickr as "U.S.Government Works." Use of this notice should be required to identify Government Works in analog and digital formats, including objects (sentence, paragraph, image, graph, document, etc.), compilations, collections, datasets, whole websites, etc.<br /><br />No other notice will do:<br /> A "Creative Commons" tag is not appropriate because it is a license that permits certain uses of a copyrighted work. Domestically U.S. Government works are not copyrighted; any and all uses are allowed and, therefore, no license is necessary.<br />The Flickr tag "No known restrictions" used for Library of Congress photographs is not appropriate because it implies and leaves open the question of copyright ownership.<br />A "Public Domain" tag is not appropriate because works enter the public domain when their term of protection has expired or if the author failed to comply with the formalities required by the Copyright Law at the time the work was created. The exclusion of U.S. Government works from copyright protection is not dependent on the date of creation or publication or when the author died (x factor) or amendments to the law that changed the equations.<br /><br />COPYRIGHTED INFORMATION DISSEMINATED BY GOVERNMENT<br />Government agencies often advise that information on their websites "is considered public information and may be distributed or copied unless otherwise specified." This notice contradicts the copyright law as amended in 1989 when the United States joined the Berne Convention adopting international standards. While use of a copyright notice and registration was once required as a condition of copyright protection in the United States, it is now optional. A work is not in the public domain or not copyrighted simply because it does not have a copyright notice. Absence of a notice introduces an element of uncertainty, especially when a work is separated from the Government source. <br /><br />Users often assume that information disseminated by Federal agencies is in the public domain and unprotected by copyright. However, much information distributed by the U.S. Government is subject to terms and conditions of use based on private entity intellectual property rights, including:<br />- Copyrighted works for which the government has unlimited transferable rights under contract, grant or other agreement.<br />- Copyrighted works for which the government or an agency has a nontransferable license or permission for a specified use.<br /> - Copyrighted works used by the government under an alternative copyright license scheme (Creative Commons, etc.)<br />- "Fair uses" of preexisting copyrighted works incorporated into Government works.<br />In these instances, the other tags for noting copyright would be appropriate.<br /><br />The consequence of not marking the copyright status of government information is that the time, cost and burden of doing an after-the-fact copyright analysis is passed to users, both government and citizens and the margin of error is substantial even for those who are knowledgeable about copyright and contract law.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Fosters innovation and creativity through free use of government works while respecting the intellectual property rights of others.</div><br />	bgktoby	-3	5	8	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3310-4049

3314-4049	FACEBOOK and “The Department of Mary Jones”	2009-05-26 00:00:00	During Vice President Gore's National Performance Review, some of the staff began to fantasize about reinventing social services to create "the Department of Mary Jones." FACEBOOK can make that fantasy a reality. This would bring unity to the most dispiriting, inefficient stovepipes* in American government today.<br /><br /> The idea behind "The Department of Mary Jones" was that the organizing principle of social services should be the client, not the providers of health, welfare, housing, education, etc. We were 'reinventing government' back then, and what would make more sense?<br /><br />---<br />*As we now know, only on the East and West Coasts do we refer to "stovepipe" agencies. In the Midwest, they're known as "silos." We can't even agree on the same terminology for the vertical focus of most government agencies. We're caught in the same trap!<br /><br /> Our "Department of Mary Jones" (for I was a Deputy Director of the NPR) would have provided immediate access to all of the information about Ms. Jones, and encouraged/facilitated/mandated coordination among her contacts with food stamps, Section 8 Housing, the police, the juvenile justice system, her welfare case worker, the guidance counselors at her children's schools, and so forth. Such a system would provide enable the social worker to find out if there was a problem with food stamps or housing, and the school guidance counselors to notify the social workers of suspected abuse within minutes of seeing a bruised child.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This Administration could solve the privacy and financing problems involved, and such a "loosely coupled" system, based on Facebook and easy to learn and teach, could go a long way to solving old, old problems of silos and stovepipes.

3316-4049	Complex, Critical, and Urgent (1)	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Complex, Critical, and Urgent (1)<br /><br />Daniel Boone was America's first Libertarian. Whenever he saw smoke rising from a neighbor's cabin, he moved his family west. Government wasn't the problem, government wasn't the solution - at least until the Indians came a'callin'. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., appointed to the Supreme Court at age 62, once said "In the law, an ounce of history is worth a pound of logic."<br /><br />Today's problems are far too complex, critical, and urgent to be solved by either Libertarians or logic - or even lawyers. We need to use the best science available to design and test government's moves against present and emerging societal (and planetary) problems. And those sciences aren't biology and physics. They're systems theory, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory systems dynamics, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics computer simulation, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation and others http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_science - the whole lot of the sciences developed since World War II. Names like Norbert Weiner, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener John von Neumann, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann Stafford Beer, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Stafford_Beer and Jay Forrester http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester are not familiar to the lawyers who make up the vast majority of legislators and staff on Capitol Hill. Such subjects don't come up in law school - ever!<br /><br />Take global climate change (Please!). Last week Steven Pearlstein of the Post wrote a column about the complexity of the Waxman-Markey bill. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/21/AR2009052104402.html In it he says: <br /><br />"There remains a robust argument over whether the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 represents a crucial step in preserving life as we know it. But there is no question that there are few pieces of legislation that are likely to have a more profound effect on the U.S. economy. It would bring about dramatic changes in the relative prices of energy and goods produced by energy-hungry industries. It would redistribute trillions of dollars in business sales and household income and generate hundreds of billions in government revenue. And it would represent the most dramatic extension of government's regulatory powers into the workings of the economy since the early days of the New Deal.<br /> "For all that, there are probably not more than a few hundred people who really understand what's in this legislation, how it would work and what its impact is likely to be. As it moves through the legislative process, it's worthy of closer attention.<br /> "The other thing to say about it is that it is a badly flawed piece of public policy. It is so broad in its reach and complex in its details that it would be difficult to implement even in Sweden, let alone in a diverse and contentious country like the United States. It would create dozens of new government agencies with broad powers to set standards, dole out rebates and tax subsidies, and pick winning and losing technologies, even as it relies on newly created markets with newly created regulators to set prices and allocate resources. Its elaborate allocation of pollution allowances and offsets reads like a parody of industrial policy authored by the editorial page writers of the Wall Street Journal. The opportunities for waste, fraud and regulatory screwup look enormous."<br /><br />(Another article http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/25/AR2009052502264.html<br /> in the Post, well worth reading, says "The proposal is far more complex than anything tried before in this country, and a close parallel in Europe turned out to be seriously flawed.")<br /><br />I like Pearlstein; I don't find him an ideologue at all. When he's nervous, I'm nervous. And the entire column is worth reading - twice. But there's one sentence that's entirely wrong: "For all that, there are probably not more than a few hundred people who really understand what's in this legislation, how it would work and what its impact is likely to be."<br /><br />Unless and until someone tells me that there's a very good simulation model of the US economy, and that Waxman-Markey has been plugged into it under a broad variety of assumptions, I don't think that there's ANYONE who understands how it would work and what its impact is likely to be!<br /><br />Wanna bet? Wanna bet the economy or the planet?<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>As above, "Today's problems are far too complex, critical, and urgent to be solved by either Libertarians or logic - or even lawyers."

3319-4049	A Safer Financial System -- Try Enterprise Architecture!	2009-05-26 00:00:00	<br /><br /><br />An article in Friday's Post reports that "The board in charge of sanctioning mortgage lenders who violate Federal Housing Administration policies is ineffective and slow at a time when the volume of loans backed by the agency is exploding, according to an inspector general's report scheduled for release today." This board has ruled on only 94 cases since October, although 12,641 lenders do business with FHA.<br /><br />I began to wonder if ANYONE had "the big picture" of how the Federal Government interacts with the financial sector's myriad actors. While I'd love to see a serious attempt at simulating the overall system, at minimum we need an Enterprise Architecture for the government side. And we know how to do that!<br /><br />The article continues: "The concern is that some lenders may be using the same abusive tactics that contributed to the collapse of the subprime market and that the FHA may not have the resources or policies to stop them and protect itself against losses. The agency insures lenders against defaults." So here we go again!<br /><br />An "Enterprise Architecture" is a set of models of the enterprise showing the relationships between its people, processes, and information. That's a simple definition - the topic gets into the weeds quickly, as you'd expect from a discipline developed at the Pentagon.<br /><br />But EA is spreading: the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 mandated EA programs at each agency, sponsored by the local Chief Information Officer (CIO). There's a Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEA) issued by the CIO Council in 1999 to standardize it across agencies. And now OMB requires an EA for funding approval and oversight. And once OMB requires something, it's really in!<br /><br />That means we have a language, and a community of those who speak it, that can accurately describe "the people, processes, and information" involved in the oversight of the financial system. With luck, EA might also describe the financial system itself!<br /><br />And if we had common understandings of how the system works, and graphic displays of the parts and their interactions, and maybe even color coded indications of the competence of the regulators (the Mortgage Review Board would be RED), maybe we'd have a better handle on how to fix it. What a concept!<br /><br />Just google "enterprise architecture for beginners" for starters.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>We need a financial system that's "FAIL-SAFE," not "Too Big To Fail" (see my blog at www.government-reform.info for more)</div><br />	robert	3	7	4	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3319-4049	
3320-4049	"FAIL-SAFE" and "Too Big To Fail"	2009-05-26 00:00:00	<br /><br /><br />On May 9th, a Bloomberg News headline read: "Obama Administration Said to Favor Fed as Systemic Risk Agency."<br /><br />The article says that one candidate for Systemic Risk Agency (or SRA) is the Federal Reserve Bank. Others in the Administration favor a council of regulators. That would be an SRC, or Systemic Risk Council. This will take awhile to sort out.<br /><br />And the article goes on to quote Senator Dodd (D, CT): "Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said in a May 6 hearing that 'It is my preference that authority not lie in any one body; we cannot afford to replace Citi-sized financial institutions with Citi-sized regulators,' referring to Citigroup Inc., one of the largest U.S. financial firms."<br /><br />Barney Frank talked about systemic risk regulators several months ago. A Systemic Risk Regulator would be designed to assure that all those financial entities that are "too big to fail" wouldn't even get CLOSE to failing, ever again.<br /><br />MY problem is that any reasonable person would want to get rid of the systemic risk to the financial system, not regulate or oversee it. That reasonable person would want to break up any entity that was "too big to fail." Is that rocket surgery?<br /><br />Another Bloomberg article purports to report back from 2088 about our financial crisis and its aftermath. Deeply suspicious of government action, the article lists several unintended consequences, and starts with this truism: "The U.S. Congress, which excels at preventing the last crisis from recurring, enacted new rules and regulations before the last bank had extricated itself from the government's grip." [Emphasis added]<br /><br />We shouldn't settle for a good faith effort to try to create ways to restrain firms that are Too Big To Fail. We don't just want to avoid repeating this financial meltdown. We need to avoid such failures no matter what. We need a financial system that's fail-safe. "Fail-Safe" is not a new idea.<br />And has America ever before faced this issue of keeping corporate entities from becoming too large and too powerful? Why, yes. We called the issue "monopoly" and the laws "antitrust laws." The Wikipedia entry for the Sherman Antitrust Act tells you more than you want to know.<br /><br />The (several) antitrust laws were designed to keep large businesses from harming consumers by monopolizing trade and thereby becoming able to set prices without competition. Before it atrophied, there used to be an Antitrust Division within the Justice Department, believe it or not!<br /><br />And if America decided a century ago to set limits to corporate power in order to protect consumers, why can't we do so today to protect the entire financial system?<br /><br />Why can't we aim for a financial system that's fail-safe? Shouldn't that be our design goal?<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Regulation won't prevent the NEXT financial crisis -- see the Toles cartoon in the May 27th Washington Post.</div><br />	robert	19	21	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3320-4049

Commission might even be involved.<br /><br />I've always liked the idea of commission pay in government jobs. If you don't produce you just get minimum wage but those that produce get a commission that raises their pay substantially. Potentially, such a job could start right here with someone providing ideas for free. If they stand out from the crowd there would be a security check on them before any invitation and if they failed the security check they just wouldn't be invited to the next level.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It provides a pool that anyone can be in who is willing to be involved in a forum such as this.

3325-4049	Teaching citizens how to facilitate and experience true dialogue	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Engage facilitators to teach neighborhood and organizational representatives how to facilitate short-form dialogue processes / methods. <br /><br />There is an existing network of Obama neighborhood organizers - add in other representatives from local nonprofits, businesses, local government, faith communities and other organizations. <br /><br />To this group, teach proven dialogue methods for engaging conversation and discussion - forms of dialogue which can engage a group in 3 hours or less. Only certain forms work for this but they work very well. These trainings are best done over time to teach a skill, allow practice of the skill, return to share experiences and best practices, apply again: action learning.<br /><br />Dialogue tools help individuals understand across differences, share experiences, listen for common threads in someone else's viewpoint, combine diverse ideas or cultural ways of looking at things to solve problems, gather data to see a full-systems perspective on an issue or opportunity, engage people, foster collaboration, and tap into rich knowledge and cultural diversity in the process.<br /><br />Use professional facilitators who are skilled in these particular methods and who also understand how to teach. They can be the mentors to the community facilitators as a community of learning and practice is fostered. <br /><br />Invitation is essential - invite across organization, region, age, ability, experience, culture, class - the key is to identify and train people who set ego aside in service to the group and its work - who invite and engage rather than direct.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The process, which is also the goal: Raise the capacity of individual Americans to engage others in dialogue - and to be able to listen well to consider another's experience. This raises the capacity of all Americans to be better neighbors - in their organizations, communities, and as world neighbors. Better family members. Better voters. Better world travelers, peace-builders, inquirers, co-workers, collaborators, idea generators - better citizens of the world...</div><br />	lisaheft	80	85	5	8	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3325-4049

Many wish to limit the size of such structures. Some talk about the increase in taxes that will be incurred by larger roads to serve the shopping area. The idea I liked was for the shopping center to locate itself on the old D&H; railway right of way and establish light rail connecting outlying communities to Albany. The shopping center could have their own station and people wishing to visit could park anywhere along the right of way and catch the train to the shopping maul for free. The cost to the taxpayer would be less in the long run and there would be many other advantages to the locals and business.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>An attempt at an innovative alternative to building more big highways.</div><br />	azaleahs	7	11	4	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3327-4049	
3328-4049	The Process of Illumination !!	2009-05-26 00:00:00	This is the second of a series of dialogue topics for the many discussion groups already formed. The purpose is to create a more open and inclusive collective worldview one worldview at a time. <br /><br />EVERYTHING CONNECTED TO EVERYTHING IS A MESS<br />Nothing is a Simple, Separate Thing. <br />H B Gelatt <br /><br />When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it is hitched to<br />everything in the universe. John Muir <br /><br />Systems scientist Russell Ackoff in Designing the Future 1974, pointed out that since nothing exists in complete isolation, every problem interacts with other problems and therefore is part of a set of interrelated problems, a "system of problems". Since English did not have a word for this, he coined the term mess and said even a simple problem is a minimess. He offered an intervention strategy called "mess management." <br /><br />Systems Theory has taught us that we don't learn about the whole by studying the parts, we learn about the parts by studying the whole. Russell Ackoff explains mess management: "The behavior of a mess depends more on how the parts interact than on how they act independently of each other." The key to mess management is the way you see the problem --- see it as a holistic system of problems. And solve it with multiple, inclusive, big-picture, creative interventions. <br /><br />I think this is a good way to think about the interconnectedness of all things. If everything is interconnected to everything else in an unbroken wholeness, as the new sciences tell us, and if "Each part is the whole, how are you supposed to make sense out of that? Don't worry if you can't understand all of this; it's called "Chaos Theory. Interconnectedness is the theme of this article and it is something almost no one totally understands. Think of it as a mess<br /><br />Everyone seems to agree that President Obama inherited a mess when he took office. He has said that he wished he could try to manage one problem at a time but realized that he couldn't. Actually he shouldn't, because messy, interconnected, unbroken whole problems, like our national or world or personal problems, are not independent problems looking for independent solutions. <br /><br />Adopting this theme and applying Ackoff's Mess Management intervention to solving national and personal problems is my proposal for dealing holistically with a system of interconnected problems.<br /><br />Practice Mess Management <br />You think because you understand one you must understand two because<br /> one and one makes two. But you must also understand and. Sufi saying<br /><br />You cannot solve a holistic mess or a minimess with single-handed or single-minded strategies. For example, America's economic problem, health care problem, education problem and energy problem of today are clearly interconnected and interrelated. Even one person's individual problem is an interconnected "mini-mess."<br /><br />Willis Harman explained the need for interconnected solutions even for one person's "mini-mess." health problem. <br />Suppose someone has a heart attach. An obvious intervention is a coronary bypass. But surgery alone will not be sufficient if the person's lifestyle is a contributing factor. Thus another intervention is to persuade the person to change his or her entire lifestyle, including goals and values. But fear and resistance may make this difficult; thus a third way of helping is to provide environmental conditions that will make it easier for this person to re-examine and change his or her lifestyle <br /><br />I can identify with this example because three years ago I had a heart attack, went to emergency, had a stent and pacemaker inserted in my body, and revised some of my behaviors and attitudes. However, another major intervention was changes in my environmental situation. My wife Carol and I rearranged the kitchen cupboards by eliminating most packaged goods, and items containing high levels of sodium, fat, and sugar. We dramatically modified our menus and cooking style. I made sure to continue my active exercise activities. These multiple interventions have lead to a healthier interconnected lifestyle. But my multiple mess management strategy needs to continue into the future. <br /><br />To practice your own mess management means involving the whole big picture with multiple interventions, such as: Take direct action (surgery). Modify behavior and attitude, (new diet restrictions and optimistic beliefs). Provide environmental conditions conducive to change, (food availability and cooking style). Considering the future, long-term consequences of all interventions is also necessary. <br /><br />Mess management applies in personal mini-messes (heart attack) and in national and global messes (economic, educational, etc.). You don't hold only surgery responsible for your future health well-being. And you don't hold only the banks or the school responsible <br />for future economic and educational well being. Problems aren't solved by fixing one or two parts. Today interventions require a whole new inclusive frame of reference. <br /><br />What Do You Think?<br />Does mess management have any application to government interventions, international interventions or personal interventions? What is your perspective on interconnectedness?<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	hb	4	7	3	5	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3328-4049	
3329-4049	Child Support should be transparent	2009-05-26 00:00:00	this is for post Idea # 137<br />Its not linked to my account so I have done it this way...<br /><br />http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2600-4049<br /><br /><br />As child support stands a non-custodial parent is pays 33% net of his/her income -that is before taxes and other items.<br /><br />However, once it has been paid the parent has no rights to know what the money is used for. The non-custodial parent (child supporter) must pay taxes on this money and receives no tax deductions!<br /><br />With no legal means to know if the money is being used to support the child or children, and no legal tools to prevent abuse of the money. The parent is able to bring the other to court every three years and ask for an increase.<br /><br />It would be fair a just have the options (by law) in support money deposited in a "child support" account and transparent to both parents and the courts. <br /><br />Also, child support should be tax deductible in helping the financial sacrifice made and supporting two health and affordable homes for the children.<br /><br />--For too long the child support has in times been used as a weapon of power over another and is unfairly balanced in favor of one parent -this is sexist and suggested the other is not of equal in parenting. The person paying child support has very little legal tools to monitor what is to be money for the children. <br /><br />Living, food, clothing, medical are examples of what the money is rightly needed for. Beer, drugs, parents clothing, concert tickets are some examples of items that could be considered non-supportive while the other sacrifices financially.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Josh Senecal	9	15	6	6	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3329-4049

3334-4049	Region Builder Database to Compile Census FIPS Code Alphabetical Data Geographically	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Census FIPS codes are alphabetic and do not allow regional aggregation to match the sub-state districts of councils of government, regional councils, regional commissions, economic development districts, etc. organized in the 1960s-1970s. Metropolitan Statistical Area data is a market measure which changes based on commuting patterns. These have extended over the past 30 years and do not match local government relationships built in the same time period. Exurban counties which come into the commutershed are not peers of the MSA central communities - expanding COGs isn't practical, but networking between regions is. This has been done with the Mid-Atlantic Regional Planning Roundtable since 2003. The next event is October 1 in Frederick, MD. Wash COG is a sponsor along with the Regional and Intergovernmental Planning Division of APA. To support the regional analysis, I developed a geo-coding system that will enable a region-builder database. There are many in the Federal Government who say this is needed, it just can't be done. I have a proposal and have presented it as: "The Sub-State District/Regional Council as a Geospatial Unit of Analytical Geography for the United States - Shenandoah Valley Pilot Project" at the GSA Collaborative Expedition Workshop #48 - February 21, 2006. After 35 years in regional planning, I retired in 2008 to further develop and promote this idea as a basis of understanding the emergence of "regional communities." In my practice I found local governments and citizens open and supportive of the notion that: "The Northern Shenandoah Valley, Virginia Planning District 7, was a "regional community of communities." As such, investing in things that supported the Northern Shenandoah Valley (region), like a regional tire shredder or the Civil War Battlefields or the Regional Commission itself, was not being disloyal to the local community. The regional community was a scale of community used as needed. This worked well in Virginia where there was an alignment of State agency sub-state districts with the Planning District boundaries. Though regional agencies were separate, they served the same territory and this enabled functional coordination and creates an efficiency in Virgina.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Many act as though there is no regional cooperation in the U.S., when in fact it has been building constantly since the 1960's and 1970's as localities in regional council territories have built trusting relationships. Those States with complete systems that are linked to public policy have a competitive advantage, but this can not be analyzed or compared since there is no data system for aggregation. There are many systems of regions in States, but few are aligned. Alignment could bring a transparency to costs of existing systems that would lead to efficiencies. Emphasis is on consolidation and merger and inefficiencies with in the states. The data is available, it just can't be aggregated to the boundaries where local and state governments can be analytical state to state in comparable regions. Terminology is confusing to the citizens. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA)include much rural territory. Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) do not cover all the territory of a County - only the "urbanized" area. So MSA is not MPO is not full jurisdictions. Without data, the necessity and benefit of more functional regional community cooperation will not occur. Local government relations are highly formalized. There is nothing that can be done without resolutions, MOU's, etc. I've used my newsletter and Regional Communities blog to show through news reports and blogs how regional communities are working in the U.S. and throughout the world. All communities face similar challenges. Those that learn to work together - have built "bridging social capital" per Robert Putnam, do better.

3337-4049	TRAVEL	2009-05-26 00:00:00	The federal travel systems are broken and have opened the door to waste, fraud, and abuse.<br /><br />1) Pair city contracts are very costly compared to discount internet sites. <br /><br />Examples as of 5/27/2009<br /><br />Cities (round trip) Pair City Contract Cost Discount Internet<br /><br />Salt Lake City, Utah to<br /> Bismark, North Dakota $1,431.25 v. $488.00<br /><br />San Antonio, TX to<br /> New Orleans, LA $379.50 v. $154.00<br /><br />San Antonio, TX to<br /> Denver, CO $537.50 v. $138.00<br /><br />Agencies have a policy to allow use of the discount fares if it "Benefits the Government" however the process of obtaining approvals is so cumbersome that the approval cannot be obtained in a timely manner to recognize the savings and make the reservation. And while the pair city contracts have cancellation / change benefits (no cost), the cost of including a change/cancellation fee is still less expensive than the pair city costs.<br /><br />Depts/Agencies/Bureaus should allow common sense to prevail when making travel arrangements. If the employee can save money by booking a flight through a discount site they should not be required to get approval first. Just require evidence of savings should be sufficient to support reason for using discount airfare, hotel, or car rentals.<br /><br />2) Employee' are not required to provide receipts for anything over $75.00 so claims can be made for taxi's when free or less costly shuttle was actually used, claims for checked bags when bags were carried on, claims for entire per diem when dollar menu was used, claims for mileage to and from airport when mileage is exaggerated, travelers do not fill up rental car and pay the rental agency gas fee (which is much higher) for a full tank of gas when they return the vehicle, claims made for porters and only had one bag. These are just a few of the 'doors' that have been left open because the federal government doesn't want to have all of the paper work. The travel reimbursement for these 'additional costs' directly to the federal employee is tax free. Recommend the federal government require receipts for all travel reimbursements claimed and use the internet to confirm trip mileage claimed when using the federal employee uses their POV. Federal government employees who are using tax dollars should be held to a higher standard when reporting travel reimbursement.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Saves Money and Reduces Deficit</div><br />	Tax Payer & Civil Servant	12	13	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3337-4049	
3339-4049	Facilitate a We the People conversation that generates shared solutions to our most pressing issues	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Our current system is based on the idea that good collective decisions arise from a competition among self-interested parties. But increasingly we face collective problems that require a spirit of cooperation while embracing individual wisdom and expression. Implementing Wisdom Council processes at local, state, and national levels would facilitate a "We the People" conversation where all of us can identify, evolve, and co-create solutions to our most pressing issues in partnership with government.<br /><br />The Wisdom Council process is seemingly a lot like other citizen involvement processes. However, it offers the possibility of systemic change that all of us support in a way that is similar to our founding experience. <br /><br />Every four months a group of twelve citizens is randomly selected from a list of registered voters in the community (city, state, or nation). Each "Wisdom Council" gathers for three days or so, chooses the issue to address, and is "dynamically facilitated" (www.DynamicFacilitation.com) to achieve unanimous perspectives. Following their meeting, the Wisdom Council presents its conclusions to the community in a State of the Union-type ceremony. The "Wisdom Council" then disbands but everyone in the community is invited to visit about the results in face-to-face and web-based conversations, and through social networks and informal reflections. <br /><br />For example, a Wisdom Council could frame issues and generate solution strategies for other citizen involvement processes to explore, such as those mentioned in the idea proposals: "Use randomly selected Citizen Deliberative Councils to tap the collective wisdom of We the People" http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2971-4049, "A National Citizens' Assembly to represent the people's wisdom" http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2535-4049, and "a Citizen Councilor Network: Scalable, Manageable, and Measurable" http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/2895-4049; or through Creative Insight Councils, which are similar to Wisdom Councils. <br /><br />The aim is to involve all of us in one, ongoing, collaborative conversation about the issues that matter most, where we talk creatively and, over time, reach intelligent, shared conclusions. That is, with the Wisdom Council process in place, we can speak in an empowered way as "We the People," establishing shared perspectives, a clear vision of what we want, and realistic strategies for change.<br /><br />The most important feature of the Wisdom Council process, which distinguishes it from other approaches where randomly selected citizens are gathered to address issues in the name of all, is in the quality of talking and thinking it facilitates. Some processes rely on deliberation where, for example, people are given the topic of health care, with proposed solution options and balanced information. They carefully weigh the options and vote on which they prefer. Other processes rely on dialogue, where, for example, people explore topic of racism, telling experiences, sharing values, and transforming their views. Still other processes focus on negotiation, or problem-solving, or consensus-building as the desired way of talking and thinking.<br /><br />The Wisdom Council process aims at "choice-creating," where people identify and address the most pressing issues, think about them open-mindedly and open-heartedly, and seek shared outcomes that will work for everyone. Unlike our normal political decision-making processes, choice-creating relies on individual expression and uniqueness to explore the full complexity of issues and reach conclusions that work for all. Diversity is an asset. Dissonant or minority views can be safely expressed and heard, which in turn, allow us to generate more complete and innovative solutions. <br /><br />In our experience to date, people resonate with the work of the Wisdom Council. So when the Wisdom Council presents its conclusions at the end of three days, the usual reaction of the rest of the community is to concur, essentially saying "We think so, too!" Because the Wisdom Council is not given its topic but chooses its own, "the People" are in the driver's seat. And the process is ongoing instead of being finished when the topic is completed. <br /><br />For more information: See the book, "Society's Breakthrough! Releasing Essential Wisdom and Virtue in All the People" (www.SocetysBreakthrough.com) The Center for Wise Democracy (www.WiseDemocracy.org) is a non profit organization has many articles and videos, and has helped interested citizen groups learn about this process and experiment with it in Victoria BC, Oakland CA, Pleasantville NY and other cities. Arising from these experiments the government of the state of Vorarlberg in Austria is helping organize Wisdom Councils in that region, where citizens become involved in solving difficult problems. In 2010 a prominent nonprofit organization in the country of Armenia will begin the first national trial there.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Most of our pressing impossible-seeming problems in society are systemic in nature. The Wisdom Council process offers a safe way to engage our system in forming a "We the People" to take charge of it. </div><br />	deanna	69	77	8	7	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3339-4049

3347-4049	To Make FOIA Work, Costs of Non-Disclosure Must Be Greater than Benefits	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Charge agencies daily substantial penalties for each day past statutory deadlines on FOIA request, this may be done by executive order, I believe. Charges should come from overall budget of agency, not FOIA department. Failure to answer FOIA requests by government officials should also be punished by individual reprimands and other administrative sanctions. These guidelines could be worked out by OPM across all agencies to be fair and reasonable--and to provide reasonable incentives for agencies to disclose whenever possible (rather than deny access, now the CYA default).<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Right now, the only penalty in a FOIA case for non-compliance is the award of legal fees to the requester...the lawyer's time is worth money under statue, the agency's time is worth money (reasonable fees may be charged for search and copies), yet the requester's time is not worth money. But information, especially time-sensitive information, has value--and often the requester has a time value for the information. Information in 20 days may be worth more than information in 2 years, especially regarding matters of public interest that affect policy.<br /><br />If information may only be revealed after the issue is moot, especially in controversial matters, what was the point of FOIA in the first place?<br /><br />Any official doing a cost/benefit analysis right now must calculate that the risk of disclosure outweighs the risk of denial. That calculus must change for FOIA to become more effective.</div><br />	Laurence Jarvik	12	16	4	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3347-4049	
3349-4049	Training on Facilitative Leadership 	2009-05-26 00:00:00	In order to create a program of dynamic public engagement, elected officials and government staff need training in the process and skills required to be successful - and this is a great opportunity to develop such trainings. <br /><br />In order to support effective public engagement, leaders from federal, state and city government need to learn best practices for engaging the public, to understand:<br /><br />* Facilitative leadership: they are the conveners of a process, whose purpose is to gather wisdom from many people. They need to identify and include the stakeholders who have a stake or interest, to help solve a problem that no one agency can solve by themselves. Government officials shouldn't feel the need to have all the answers.<br /><br />* The need for ongoing support and guidance: it's not enough to convene a meeting of several hundred people. Citizens bring their skills and energies, and a willingness to work with government. They need ongoing support and resources to carry out action plans - people to help them identify their purpose and goals, help with, or training, on effective facilitation of meetings, funding for materials or professional assistance. <br /><br />* Bringing citizens together to help solve problems raises their expectations. If the conveners - state, federal or local government - cannot deliver the resources or can't stay engaged in the implementation, then it's better not to convene citizens in the first place. <br /><br />Here are some issues to address in a training on "How to conduct public engagement:" <br /><br />* Who's involved in sponsoring the event? Who else needs to be involved? How do we get their buy-in?<br />* How do we get the right people in the room? Who are the "right" people? How do we get the non-mainstream people, or people who feel marginalized, to participate?<br />* How do we build bridges and trust before the event? <br />* What do we need to address so that people don't shrug their shoulders and dismiss the event as "another misguided effort" by the politicians?<br />* What is our responsibility to participants? Are we raising expectations that we can't fulfill?<br />* What resources do we need in order to support the outcomes that the participants generate? What organizations need to be included as sponsors in order to provide those resources?<br />* What kind of support and guidance should we commit to providing if we're going to hold such a summit?<br />* What are the components of an engaging meeting or summit? How do we make it participatory? What kinds of activities should we steer away from?<br />* How do we get people to engage with one another? How do we build community in such an event?<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Knowing how to create and facilitate public meetings, to get buy-in and commitment from various stakeholder groups, to build community and to generate collaboration - all of these are essential leadership skills that are critical for conveners of public engagement. <br /></div><br />	abbyyanow	38	41	3	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3349-4049

The same is true for teachers, doctors, engineers, lawyers, biologists, sociologists... and on, and on and on. Try to hire a recently graduated acquisiton professional. There is no degree program in acquisition anywhere in the United States.

This distorts congressional votes and the design of proposed laws to favor special interests rather than the general interest of the country. Thus little can be accomplished in the way of implementing laws for the common good unless funding of congressional elections is provided by public money. We must demand that laws be passed to make all federal elections publically funded. It is done in many states and other countries. It can and must be done if any other real reforms are to be accomplished.

Agency Programs and Offices Lacking Stand-Alone Missions	2009-05-26 00:00:00	There are many offices in the Federal government that are staffed with purely overhead positions performing duplicative staff functions. Retrain employeed who work in these offices into positions that actively support that agency's constituent audience of the American people.<br /><br />In essence, review what each office is supposed to do and what it actually does in light of what it should contribute to the agency's reason for existence and also to ensure other offices' work does not overlap with it.<br /><br />For example, there are well over 40 programs that provide some kind of food program to poor children and they are spread among USDA, HHS, and other departments. Definitely a worthy cause to feed poor kids in our country but one that could be made more effective if all those programs were brought under one management system; combining the programs (or parts of programs) that are similar. I believe this would not only create internal efficiencies but give a better understanding of the programs' impact at the state and local levels, and create cost-effectiveness.<br /><br />Centralize functions that are agency-wide--HR, EEO and make sure those programs report only to HR or EEO.

They know most attorneys work on hourly rates far higher than the employee's salary so the agencies do not comply with the regulation requiring them to settle the complaint at every step.

The agency walks away with a clean EEO record. <br /><br />The current 180-day formal complaint period before the employee gets the agency's report of investigation with its foregone conclusion that the employee did not have a valid complaint contributes to the perception that the EEO process is toothless and takes away another right of protection for the employees.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	webmaster	10	13	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3365-4049

3367-4049	Provide useful automated guidance to citizens in common, recurring situations	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Lists of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) can be useful to address common problems and issues. But FAQs often require people to read through lots of text in the hope of finding an answer relevant to their situation -- a problem that worsens as FAQ systems grow. Even when an apparently relevant answer has been found, the user then needs to figure out how to adapt the standard/general answer in a FAQ to his or her particular situation. FAQ systems also tend to be Web-only, with no access via phone, thus excluding many if not most citizens from participation. Government can and should do better than this.<br /><br />Technology now exists to create systems that ask a few questions to identify and distinguish among commonly encountered situations. These systems then provide relevant guidance, automatically tailored to the particular identified situation. Such systems can deliver relevant guidance to citizens more quickly and efficiently than Web-based FAQs, and can do so via phone as well as via the Web. Government agencies should be encouraged to build such systems and to make them available for free to citizens. <br /><br />Each government agency might start by identifying and addressing the most common situations where citizens request guidance from the agency. As usage of the system grows, and as citizen feedback is received and incorporated, more and more situations could be addressed. The ultimate result of this incremental process: systems that provide situation-specific guidance to citizens, via web or phone, at any time, and from any location, to handle the most common, recurring problems and issues in a reliable and cost-effective way.<br /><br />Here are just a few examples where systems providing situation-specific guidance would likely prove popular and useful:<br /><br />- Taxpayers seeking help to comply with various IRS requirements<br />- Small businesses seeking financing from the Small Business Administration (SBA)<br />- Veterans seeking benefits guidance from the Department of Veterans Affairs<br />- Workers trying to determine how OSHA safety and health requirements apply to their workplace conditions<br />- Students looking for federal loans, grants, or scholarships to help finance their education<br /><br />Many, many more examples could easily be provided.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Providing useful, automated guidance to citizens in common, recurring situations would advance the key Open Government goals of transparency, participation, and collaboration. Government information and services would be made more accessible to citizens (transparency). Citizens would be actively involved in the extension and improvement of such systems through usage and feedback loops (participation). Automated guidance could be provided at the agency level, but also at higher levels, between agencies, among federal, state, and local governments, and even including private entities (collaboration).</div><br />	fparnon	26	27	1	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3367-4049

3376-4049	My Society: Our Problems Need Not Be Government Problems	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Invest in Web 2.0 tools to help people create transparent, flexible, Do-It-Yourself communities. Essentially, we have the technology to create our own communities with many of the benefits associated with cooperation and exchange, such as pooled resources, civic institutions, social capital, and cultural capital. We should use it and education to empower individuals, communities, and society at large.<br /><br />This kind of software can ease communication between distant people, maintain transparency, and be flexible enough to facilitate many issues. For instance, it could allow customized governing systems (direct democracy, republics, hierarchies, you name it) tailored to the community, it can automate transparent donation funded capital projects, or even run vote based public works and volunteer projects. With strong enough identification, we can even automate binding contracts that can add security and legitimacy to these projects.<br /><br />For example, a neighborhood community could create a place to voice local issues and solutions. If ten nearby families are suffering from transportation problems, they use a ride share plug-in to coordinate resources. If nearby businesses and houses are flooded, the community can pool money and bid for a contractor or use online volunteering outreach to repair the area. Whatever people come up with, you can be sure it will strengthen the community and help exercise the constitutive social practices needed to make society work.<br /><br />Still yet, the communities can be abstract, such as a community of family friends who happen to span five houses across two cities. Perhaps international travel is an important part of the experience they want to give their children, so they discuss making a shared money market account to take advantage of economies of scale, a process technology makes trivial. Moreover, since this community can be transparent, outsiders could look in and offer better solutions, such as discounted flights for large parties or more effective investment opportunities.<br /><br />Since when did our problems become government problems that we couldn't solve between ourselves? Let's make this a reality and take some burden off our bureaucratic institutions and officials, because when a hammer will do you do not need to go looking for a sledgehammer.<br /><br />We are not alone, and together we can tackle anything. Let's make the tools to take responsibility back into our hands, and make this investment that will pay dividends towards civic society down the road. This isn't rocket science; this is just computer science and democracy.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>- A healthy exercise of social capital through open discussion, trust, and exchange<br />- Empowers individuals and communities alike<br />- Transparency keeps us honest and in tune with each other, both within communities and between communities<br />- Alleviates the burden on government and keeps the responsibility with the people<br />- Helps combat moral hazards where decisions made by officials in government effect entire communities without touching the deciders</div><br />	igienger	13	18	5	10	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3376-4049

The ability to have this technology powered by the users own motion, coupled with solar acquisition gives ample resources in excess that would be required as this technology is perfected. Many of the devices exist as separate entities, some technology has already merged others are highly repeatable in the laboratory. To accelerate the merging of technology and to offer an immediate mass produced version gives all humanity the power to interact with the world with the most absolute cost effective methods available. As new opportunities of invention that could be merged into this device become available either through downloadable software upgrades or holistic product upgrades, humanity would be giving each other the most cost effective way to interact with the global community, access to science, healthcare, education and entertainment. Again, this device would be integrated and powered by the user coupled with wearable solar technology. Individually at the nanoscale, science already makes many applications possible. At the global level, merging multiple applications into one nanoscale device makes obvious sense. I would hope that through transparent review of the possibilities and further public awareness that Government support to all humanity for access to affordable wireless communications and associated imbedded applications becomes accelerated into an immediate reality. Ideas of energy conservation and modernizing how we communicate information on a global scale become apparent with a brief analysis of current abilities using satellites and wireless communications devices. We should be extraordinarily supporting the transition to this communication style as it is the most cost effective way to upgrade humanity into the 21st century.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea is important because it takes the best ideas humanity has to offer and incorporates them into a single platform that will attempt to address all concepts of governance, The transparency and the access to data wirelessly through a single platform invention.<br /><br /></div><br />	klingspoon.troy	-15	3	18	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3377-4049	
3378-4049	Beware! "Open Government" should not create yet another layer of bureaucracy...	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Some might argue that "Open Government" is a contradiction in terms - you can be open or you can have government (Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, "Yes, Minister"). But let us not be pessimitic and accept that collective contributions from citizens will be considered by our Government in making important final decisions. Clearly, the time has not yet come for this initiative to produce anything more than possibly a useful advice. This being the case, let us keep all this simple and keep Parkinson's economic laws in our mind. Here is a reminder. <br />Parkinson's Economic Laws: <br />1. Work expands to fill the time available.<br />2. Expenses rise to meet income.<br />3. The more complex, the sooner dead. <br /><br />Suggested rule: there should be no new personnel hired into the government administration in connection with the Open Government initiative. All the staff should be recruited from the existing, over-staffed government departments.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It has been quite commonly observed in recent history that the number of employees engaged in administration increased while non-administrative activities decreased. Parkinson explains this by stating that "An official wants to multiply subordinates, not rivals" and that "Officials make work for each other." (Cyril Northcote Parkinson. Parkinson's Law: The Pursuit of Progress (London, John Murray, 1958).<br /><br />This initiative must not result in swelling bureaucracy!<br /><br /></div><br />	klpetrak	5	10	5	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3378-4049	
3379-4049	Open Data Will Enable Democratized Analysis and Accountability	2009-05-26 00:00:00	In order to meet the goal of open data, the government should look to create data portals using technologies with wide market adoption, like XML-based web services. Web services such as SOAP and REST are self-documenting, quick, platform-independent, and currently allow for the most flexible access to the data in question. Third parties will make the most interesting use of the data. If a site like Recovery.org focuses on providing Open Data (timely, raw, and technologically neutral), it will leverage the passion and creativity of the populace to ensure real transparency and accountability.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>As a software architecture specialist with 15 years experience building information systems for large customers including federal agencies such as the Department of Treasury, OMB, the US Navy, the CIA and OPIC, I can assure you that that the biggest challenge with this exercise will not be the format or operating system, but rather the volume of data and complexity of providing it in real time without straining the underlying infrastructure or creating privacy risks. The identification, provision and documentation of query tables (revealing whatever data the government intends to share) is the most basic first step.<br /><br />Speaking at a technology event in Northern Virginia, newly appointed National CIO Vivek Kundra agreed that open data is the key, saying he was "deeply committed to opening up data to make it machine readable and easier for people to use/mix/mash." The real creativity will come from passionate citizens and organizations that will follow specific aspects of government regulation, and government spending. Similar to other public private partnerships, citizens and organizations will combine government data with outside sources (mash-ups) to produce useful tools that enhance our lives. A quick review of projects that have already been created from simple data dumps show just how much creativity exists. For example, www.OpenRegs.com is a website that taps into data underpinning the Federal Register and allows individuals and organizations to have a real-time look at the regulations that will affect them.<br /><br />The infinite manifestations of data suggest that the worst thing the government could do is to try and anticipate all potential uses of the data by attempting to implement some grand master system. As Kundra also said, "technology changes so fast that by the time one standard comes along, there's another, and another, which is why government can't lock-in on one standard." There will be lag time between the release of the data and the availability of functional reports but it's nothing compared the delays inherent in a monolithic and over debated central system. Never was the KISS Principle more relevant.<br /><br />Start simple, make the data available. I think we'll all be amazed at the results.<br /><br /></div><br />	jz	31	31	0	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3379-4049	
3380-4049	The technology the government uses is far less important than the tools and technologies the government enables.	2009-05-26 00:00:00	There are a myriad of new tools and technologies that will enable the administration to achieve its stated goals of transparency, participation, and collaboration in government. However, most of them havenâ&euro;&trade;t even been invented yet. <br /> <br />The technology the government uses is far less important than the tools and technologies the government enables. Achieving true accountability and transparency requires leveraging the creativity and passion of citizens and organizations from across the nation. Therefore, the technological goal should be providing open data (timely, raw, and technologically neutral) rather than trying to identify and mandate specific types of technological solutions. This will enable new technologies to be developed to analyze and utilize the information in ways the government canâ&euro;&trade;t even imagine today.<br /> <br />If the government focuses on making the data available, then smart, innovative citizens and organizations will build new tools that allow us to use and view the data in meaningful ways. Developer X might mix the data in a way that is most useful to you, and Developer Y might mash that data in a way that is particularly useful to me. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Enabling innovation and transparency requires technology-neutral procurement policies. The reality is that the pace of technological innovation means that the most promising technologies of today may not be relevant tomorrow. Therefore, the government should not be looking for technologies that must be adopted or mandated, but rather at the goals that it wants to achieve. Just because particular technologies have worked in the past doesn't mean they will be the right solution in the future--technology moves so fast that by the time one solution comes along, another better one is right on its heels. And that's one reason why the government shouldn't lock-in to a one-size-fits-all solution for access, transparency, and<br /><br />participation.<br /><br /> <br /><br />True openness is about being inclusive rather than exclusive, and keeping the government technology-neutral is an additional way to ensure openness and participation.<br /><br /></div><br />	jz	27	28	1	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3380-4049	
3381-4049	Get Public Officials to Think about and Comment on Transparency before they are Elected 	2009-05-26 00:00:00	According to a 2008 Sunshine Week survey conducted by Scripps Howard News Service and Ohio University, three-quarters of American adults view the federal government as secretive (up from 62 percent just two years earlier), and nearly 90 percent say it's important to know presidential and congressional candidates' positions on open government when deciding for whom to vote. Those who see local government as secretive increased from 34 percent in 2007 to 40 percent in the 2008 survey. And 91 percent said the local candidate's position and record on open government are important to them in making a voting decision.<br /><br />To help restore the public's trust in government and remove the perceived veil of secrecy, candidates seeking office at every level of government should be asked to comment on their views of and specific plans for transparency, public participation and collaboration. This will help to educate and engage the public in the voting process and beyond - i.e., what their role in government can be after the election. It also will encourage officials to be as thoughtful about open government (which is sometimes construed as a "process issue") as they are about more traditional public policy issues. <br /><br />Non-partisan organizations, such as the League of Women Voters, can help to facilitate the collection and dissemination of answers via candidates' forums, online election sites, and voters guides. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	kmcfarland	77	84	7	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3381-4049	
3382-4049	Public TRUST in Government Needs to be Restored	2009-05-26 00:00:00	An open and accessible government is critical to any healthy democracy. However, equally important is its citizenry's trust in its government - in what is being shared and how it is being shared. If the public does not trust the information that it sees or reads (or the source providing it), then the efforts are fruitless.<br /><br />There has been a decline in public confidence in government at all levels (local, state & federal). When asked in a Public Strategies/Politico poll released in January 2009, 62 percent of respondents indicated that their confidence in the federal government had decreased in the previous 12 months, while 8 percent indicated that it had increased. <br /><br />Transparency in Rebuilding Understanding and Solutions Together (TRUST), a coordinated campaign to help restore public confidence, is needed. Components would include: <br />1. Convening public conversations about how to define trust in government - i.e., what does it look like?<br />2. Establishing and adhering to a set of principles to help promote civic engagement<br />3. Providing federal, state and local government agencies with a set of best practices for citizen participation<br />4. Educating the public about government accountability efforts<br />5. Recognizing and rewarding agencies and citizens for their vital roles in keeping our democracy healthy, vibrant and strong<br /><br />Without addressing this core challenge, any reforms to government transparency are likely to be cast aside - perceived as "business as usual." Building upon the record breaking participation in the 2008 elections, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity now to implement the types of changes that are needed to restore public confidence, increase citizen participation and strengthen our democracy for all. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	kmcfarland	67	70	3	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3382-4049

The key to DSG is that the Dutch engineer who developed it 4 decades ago came up with a way to keep all participants equal in power: Consent decision-making for policy decisions. He also came up with many other surprising structural innovations like the consent election process and self-ownership.

3385-4049	FAR Definition of 'DATA' Includes Software - Encourage Re-use - Save $s	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Leverage the federal definition of â&euro;&oelig;dataâ&euro;? - The Federal IT industry will be radically changed if all government-funded data (work products like software code, models, and other artifacts) is transparent and accessible. The publishing of all types of data, especially software code and business process models, by Federal contractors should be encouraged. One way to do this is to value re-use strategies when evaluationg procurements. Just as we value past performance we should value re-use strategies, including the commercial publishing of govermnment funded IT activities as open source software. This commercial approach will stimulate a whole new range of shared solutions and encourage better integration of services across the government.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>If the Administration focus on transparency makes the more broadly defined "data" (i.e. not just traditional databases) available a whole new eco-system that promotes re-use of IT assets will lead to vast increases in effeciency.</div><br />	Peter Gallagher	5	10	5	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3385-4049	
3386-4049	Grassroots Leadership on Civic Participation	2009-05-26 00:00:00	While the three components of the Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government are intertwined, it seems that there are specific constituencies that are better suited to take the lead in helping to implement positive change in each of these areas. The federal government can model the transparency and collaboration principles by testing and implementing new technologies, sharing best practices, and setting higher standards for all offices and agencies. This information can flow downward to state and local governments for implementation.<br /><br />Research Component<br />In the area of participation, we need to look to the grassroots - to those who are already engaged in our democracy. We need to understand what individuals and organizations are already doing to help safeguard our democracy. Are these replicable? What can be done to engage others? How do we foster and support civic engagement? How do make active and informed participation in government a priority to busy families? <br /><br />Monitoring & Convening Component<br />Trusted community organizations, such as the League of Women Voters, have been on the "frontlines" acting as government watchdogs for decades by monitoring government meetings, performing FOIA audits, and convening town hall meetings on "hot topics." What can be learned from this group and others like it?<br /><br />Starting Point<br />Citizens feel most attached to their local government. This is the level of government that they relate to on a daily basis; from school funding to zoning issues, local government impacts our lives. It only seems logical that any efforts to bolster citizen participation would start with this level of government. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	kmcfarland	80	83	3	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3386-4049

There are many ways to encourage re-use of technology including the use of COTS software. In recent years the application of open source COTS (open source is COTS by OMB definition) has shown promise of providing a whole new range of options for re-use as compared to proprietary COTS. If acquisition evaluation criteria regularly valued the cross-government re-use potential by using an open source approach there would be a dramatic shift in commercial response to IT initiatives.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Valuing re-use in acquistion has the potential to easily and quickly increase the use of common software tools and architectures.</div><br />	Peter Gallagher	7	8	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3387-4049

3389-4049	Train leaders how to build trust to support collaboration	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Leaders often don't know how to build the strong trust necessary for people to fully engage in collaboration. Instituting a training program focused on building, maintaining and, when necessary restoring trust in government workplaces would directly support the use of collaboration. <br /><br />Trust doesn't just happen, it requires attention and practice. But people have to know what to pay attention to before they can practice. Workplaces are minefields of limited time, competing commitments, opposing demands, and miscommunication that can easily lead to unintended breaches of trust when people aren't paying attention. When they aren't dealt with immediately these small breaches can quickly lead to distrust, which kills collaboration.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Trust is a precondition for effective collaboration. Without a strong foundation of trust between people involved collaboration won't happen. Most people don't have a good idea how to build it, maintain it or repair it when it's damaged.

3391-4049	Monitoring Data.gov for data relationships that could be exploited to do harm	2009-05-26 00:00:00	The idea behind Data.gov and the increased openness of government information is powerful and has the promise to drive increased accountability and spur innovation. The potential for the data to be used to enhance the lives of citizens and improve intergovernmental effectiveness is inherently clear. As Data.gov launches, it will be exciting to watch it grow and its impact evolve. <br /><br />However, the potential for the data to be misused is also inherently clear and must be considered and monitored. The data being submitted to Data.gov is expected to be extremely diverse and sourced from agencies throughout the government. While there is clearly no intent to release sensitive datasets, there is a risk that the non-sensitive data will to be mined for information that could be combined and exploited to do harm. <br /><br />Undoubtedly agencies will consider and will be required to consider the harm that could result from the release of their data. It is impractical to expect agencies to identify and analyze all the possible combinations of their data with the other data resident on the site. Data.gov will be too dynamic and expansive for individual agencies to know if they have inadvertently created a possible threat.<br /><br />To guard against this scenario there should be a monitoring program, possibly within the Department of Homeland Security, and/or national law enforcement agencies, to monitor and analyze the Data.gov datasets for possible threats. In addition, the public should be encouraged to identify and report any possible risks.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Proactive approach to addressing potential security risks in Data.gov datasets. </div><br />	paul.weiss	0	8	8	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3391-4049

3393-4049	First, Do No Harm	2009-05-26 00:00:00	The technology sector has created countless new tools that could enhance government transparency, but this is not the primary reason they were developed. Innovators designed these products to meet the demands of consumers in a competitive and rapidly changing marketplace. Will consumers still drive innovation if the federal government begins picking favorites?<br /><br />The federal government spent $80 billion on IT contracts in 2008. This is more than the annual revenue of Microsoft and Google combined. As a singe customer, therefore, the government could exert more influence on the market than hundreds of millions of individual users. Any government preference for one technology over another will have a profound impact on the pace and direction of innovation.<br /><br />To ensure that implementing transparency does not destroy a thriving and competitive market, the government must remain neutral and avoid choosing winners and losers. Creating an expensive and massive centralized system will give unequal power to only a few technology providers, decrease competition, limit choice, and slow the pace of innovation.<br /><br />Because the same technologies transforming modern communications are also ideal for organizing and displaying government information, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. Instead of building a cumbersome transparency infrastructure, the government can save money, promote competition, and enhance openness by embracing the Internet's greatest advantages. Releasing all information in raw format without bias will empower competition among entrepreneurs to create the most user-friendly, creative, and helpful tools for informing the public.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	dballon	17	22	5	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3393-4049

3395-4049	Create Multiple Opportunities for Communities to “Practice” Civic Engagement	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Civic Engagement at the community level isn't about a technique or a single model. It has to be about using every resource and idea possible to stay focused on the desired outcome - to create a stronger democracy by establishing ways for people to be fully engaged and connected/involved with all levels of government. As a coalition of practitioners across a variety of civic and government organizations, we recommend that the Obama Administration consider how to nurture and advance grassroot and local efforts in civic engagement between individuals and their goverment that build on local knowledge and expertise. While there are unifying themes and ideas, there are also local aspects that must be considered as the plan to engage people is developed. This is about meeting the need where people are - literally and figuratively. Local teams from communities across the country could submit innovation/seed grants for civic engagement efforts that reflect an agreed upon set of key principles, including the ones that have been determined by the national organizations involved in these initial conversations. The applications would make use of local resources and partnerships. Part of any application would also require an evaluation component. As part of this effort, the Obama Administration could create a network of practitioners trying out various approaches to community issues so that all of us could learn from each other. This model has been used very successfully by the GATES Foundation in their work--grantees are encouraged and supported to learn from each other's work. Such an approach would also provide the Federal Government with opportunities to evaluate what works and doesn't work going forward. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It is a blend of best practice, theory and local context and experience.

We offer our support to expeditiously pass legislation that includes the critical reforms listed below. Whistleblower protection is a foundation for any change in which the public can believe. It does not matter whether the issue is economic recovery, prescription drug safety, environmental protection, infrastructure spending, national health insurance, or foreign policy. We need conscientious public servants willing and able to call attention to waste, fraud and abuse on behalf of the taxpayers. <br /><br />Unfortunately, every month that passes has very tangible consequences for federal government whistleblowers, because none have viable rights. Last year, on average, 16 whistleblowers a month lost initial decisions from administrative hearings at the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). Since 2000, only three out of 53 whistleblowers have received final rulings in their favor from the MSPB. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, the only court which can hear federal whistleblower appeals of administrative decisions, has consistently ruled against whistleblowers, with whistleblowers winning only three cases out of 209 since October 1994 when Congress last strengthened the law. <br /><br />It is crucial that Congress restore and modernize the Whistleblower Protection Act by passing all of the following reforms: <br /><br />• Grant employees the right to a jury trial in federal court;<br />• Extend meaningful protections to FBI and intelligence agency whistleblowers;<br />• Strengthen protections for federal contractors, as strong as those provided to DoD contractors and grantees in last year's defense authorization legislation;<br />• Extend meaningful protections to Transportation Security Officers (screeners);<br />• Neutralize the government's use of the "state secrets" privilege;<br />• Bar the MSPB from ruling for an agency before whistleblowers have the opportunity to present evidence of retaliation;<br />• Provide whistleblowers the right to be made whole, including compensatory damages;<br />• Grant comparable due process rights to employees who blow the whistle in the course of a government investigation or who refuse to violate the law; and<br />• Remove the Federal Circuit's monopoly on precedent-setting cases.<br /><br />We know you share the commitment of every group signing the letter below to more transparency and accountability in government. Please let us know how we can participate to make this good government reform law to protect federal whistleblowers and taxpayers. <br /><br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br /> <br />Marcel Reid, Chair<br />ACORN 8<br /><br />Adele Kushner, Executive Director<br />Action for a Clean Environment<br /><br />David Swanson, co-founder<br />AfterDowningStreet<br /><br />Pamela Miller, Director<br />Alaska Community Action on Toxics<br /><br />Dan Lawn, President<br />Alaska Forum on Environmental Responsibility<br /><br />Cindy Shogun, Executive Director<br />Alaska Wilderness League<br /><br />Ruth Caplan<br />Alliance for Democracy<br /><br />Susan Gordon, Director<br />Alliance for Nuclear Accountability<br /><br />Rochelle Becker, Executive Director<br />Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility<br /><br />Gil Mileikowsky, M.D.<br />Alliance for Patient Safety<br /><br />Linda Lipsen, Senior Vice President for Public Affairs<br />American Association for Justice (AAJ)<br /><br />Mary Alice Baish, Director, Government Relations Office<br />American Association of Law Libraries<br /><br />F.

Because the birth of this transparency dialogue was so opaque, and limited to a one week turnaround during a holiday weekend, it is not realistic to organize volumes of individual posts before the White House shuts down the process. Hopefully the deep base of public support reflected in this letter will be sufficient to include the topic of whistleblowing in the blog phase of this transparency dialogue.<br /><br />Sincerely,</div><br />	shannad	169	182	13	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3397-4049

This is the real heavy lifting that will promote understanding and insight, ensuring that a "widget" in Agency A carries the same definition as a "widget" in Agency B; "Smith Construction" is the same contractor as "Smith Constr. Inc"; "EOM_BAL" is the same value as "EOM_BALANCE", etc.<br /><br />While some thought must be given to how far one goes with this, as this is can be difficult, time consuming work, raw data dumps will only amp up the confusion factor and should be avoided.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Failure to follow any disciplines here will only add to the data chaos that exists today and move us further away from real transparency.</div><br />	thomas.holahan	10	13	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3400-4049	
3401-4049	Revise OPM Report to Direct Changes in Personnel Policies for FOIA Professionals	2009-05-26 00:00:00	The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) should reconsider and revise its December 2008 report issued pursuant to Section 11 of the OPEN Government Act of 2007, regarding improving personnel practices for employees who administer the FOIA in the federal government. The report fails to recommend any meaningful action by OPM, but rather suggests a continuation of the status quo, with individual agencies having responsibility for FOIA personnel policies. But OPM CAN take action to raise the caliber of the FOIA workforce, attract and maintain trained individuals in FOIA positions, and compel other federal employees to consider information disclosure as part of their job description. OPM should also gather input from key stakeholders, including a range of agency FOIA officials, the American Society of Access Professionals (ASAP), an independent organization for FOIA and privacy professionals, and members of the FOIA requester and advocacy community. The administration should then direct OPM to issue a revised report that seriously examines "how FOIA can be better implemented at the agency level" by improving the standing and consideration of agency FOIA professionals in the personnel system.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	National Security Archive	13	17	4	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3401-4049	
3402-4049	Improper Classification of Documents	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Frequently, DOE and their contractors classify documents as Official Use Only (OUO) when those documents contain the detailed information necessary to support their (DOE) decisions when chosing between alternative approaches to solving a problem. As a result, the public cannot examine those data and the bases for the decisions that are made. Requesting these types of documents via FOIA is generally a futile exercise, since usually the document that is finally provided is severely redacted, to the point of being useless. In a recent example, the report titled "Interim Pretreatment System Pre-Conceptual Cost Estimate" was so severely redacted that ALL cost information was blacked out (about 95 pages out of about 100 pages).<br /><br />Federal agencies should be required to document in detail why any particular document should be classified as OUO, thereby requiring its contents to be hidden from public review. The rules under FOIA should be reviewed and revised to prevent arbitrary and unwarrented redaction of information from documents without explicit documentation of why that information should not be made public.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Hiding cost information which underlie decisions on which path to take when selecting among alternative approaches raises the suspicion that the analysis methodology may have been questionable, or that the results for the optimum approach may have been ignored in favor of some less suitable approach, for whatever reasons. It is very important that the agencies are open and transparent when making decisions that can strongly influence both federal expenditures and the public health and the environment associated with those decisions. </div><br />	ri_smith	21	23	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3402-4049

3404-4049	Human EMINENT DOMAIN & COMPENSATION	2009-05-26 00:00:00	FAMILY COURT IS A FOR PROFIT BUSINESS..USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!! By T.Todd<br />Thirteen years I dreamed of my son and like the movie A Beautiful Mind the little girl never aged my son remained six.<br />After receiving a call from a woman in Atlanta telling me she was checking the story of a man and his son begging for money to get to California were they said the child's mother lived. She wanted to help but the area they were in is known for crack cocaine .<br />A week after they arrived I caught him smoking crack and told him to leave without my son. I called the police to stop him from taking our son. The police told me unwed parents of minor children have equal rights. I needed to go to Sacramento Family Court<br />ask for sole physical custody so there is a record. So that's what I did.<br />Nov. 1993 custody of my baby was given to a crack-head. And ordered us to step out of the courtroom make the exchange and come back in. Procedure is to agree on a place to transfer children from one parent to the other. The child is to leave the courthouse with the parent which they came. The condition that I could ask him to test for cocaine was a relief. If he refused or results were positive my son was to be returned to me. My phone rang that evening it was my son telling me by. They were at the bus station downtown Sacramento. I calmly ask my son where were they going but he did not know. His dad would not tell me.

Today my son hates me and holds me responsible for his sleeping in wash houses, in parks, and on peoples lawn when he was with his dad.

3405-4049	Opening our past, cutting secrecy at the source	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Only a few pieces of recent legislation have had any impact on the efforts to release the growing classified archives that mark the theft of our own history by the national security state. The Nazi War Crimes Records Act and the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act have released over 15 million pages of classified documents relating to key pieces of our history, and have far outstripped the ineffective Freedom of Information Act by creating an independent board to make decisions about release, by creating a presumption of release, and by narrowing the categories that allow postponement of release. I would therefore suggest the following steps to begin to make our history our own and our government's role and response in the more recent period visible and transparent:<br />1 - Change the rules on classification of documents and records drastically to strangle the huge bureaucracy of secrecy and machinery of classification that is feeding over 15 million records (not pages, records) into literally buried history at the agencies and archives that control them. Without stopping this huge flow, efforts to release them later can barely make a dent.<br />2 - Never again allow a process or ability of the executive branch to reclassify previously released records at the archives or elsewhere, which led to over a million records being buried during the last administration.<br />3 - Renew the executive order by President Clinton to review for release all classified records 25 years or older, at a minimum. More recent would be even better. John Dean estimated that had this order been implemented over 1 billion records from our hidden past would have been released. In this executive order, create a review board under Congress through the House Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census and National Archives and on the Senate side as well. This will use the balance of powers to allow independent reviews by the executive branch and agencies alone.<br />4 - Establish a procedure for all federal, state, local, court and international records related to any major historical event of public interest since the establishment of classified records to be reviewed by a new and independent review board of historians, archivists, and impacted individuals or groups with a presumption of release, a rigorous search procedure, power of subpoena for documents and testimony, civilian advisory input, narrow standards for any postponement relating to actual direct harm to current operations or living agents or informants, and a date certain for full release of all discovered files, even if they are found in the future, under these standards.<br />5 - Create a standard procedure for all files released by any government agency to an archive or to the public through FOIA or any other review process, that a Record Information File be created with a summary of key information to make the collection searchable, and that full text search and access to all records be available online and at several repositories.<br />6 - Stengthen the FOIA by narrowing the categories of what can be withheld, by speeding the process of review making release the outcome resulting from any delay of review, not withholding, and by creating a separate, independent appeals board for documents denied to requesters, with its own timelines. Require that searches for documents not located be referred to any other agencies that might have been sent a copy of the documents sought.<br />7 - Regular Congressional oversight and hearings should be required at least annually regarding all aspects of transparency, openness and adherence to these laws. Congressional inquiries in these matters should be referred to the above mentioned historical review and FOIA appeal boards for action or decision.<br />8 - Establish a presumption of release for any records that are related to historical matters of great public interest within a reasonable period of time after the event, and disallow both executive and Congressional privilege to conceal and bury documents and investigations for periods of decades (50 to 75 years), so that no record remains classified for over 15 years in the future and that records so classified must be reviewed regularly to be sure the situation has not changed that was used to suggest they could harm anyone living or any current operation, if so requiring immediate release.<br />9 - Restore the intent of the founding fathers that a people exercising democracy must be well-informed and that secrecy is inimical to that process. Information flow and knowledge are central to any democratic decision, and democracy without that was considered a farce. Jefferson, Madison and the others knew that information was more central to democratic government than the machinery that was being used to make it function. We cannot be uneducated and free. Stealing our history, both past and recent, makes us a conquered people. Unlock the secrets.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The examples of legislation given have worked. The machinery of secrecy and classification is huge and unrelenting. Our history is being buried and democracy cannot function without information flow. Governments who hide behind secrecy cannot be democratic. Also, the release of records on our recent past have rewritten our understanding of those events in significant ways, and they always make our understanding of government accountability more clear and hopefully put more pressure towards that end. History itself has claims, of course so it should be done for that reason alone.</div><br />	copa	45	49	4	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3405-4049	
3406-4049	REFLECTIONS ON THIS SITE	2009-05-26 00:00:00	I am a simple man, of minimal accomplishments, no degree, not published and not close to being teched or tooled up.. I am a Laborer and Energy Captured individual--I try to see things in simple terms!<br /><br />If i might reflect for a moment, First, my compliments on this site as i presume it is a well intended innovation; Careful to realize most of us see and hear what we want to and things can change.<br />After seeing and reflecting on my comments and responses,, It dawned on me that:<br />1..I took this site to lightly! <br />2...I need to think about what i am saying more thoroughly ( witout bundling iems) and try to condense it! <br />3...It dawns on me the scope and scale of God only knows where and who might see my thoughts and their stupidity or foolishness..<br /><br />So i think you should look at your idea as a kind of "Letter to the Editor", with the ability to change the world or an event nearly overnight by its consensus surveying potential ( careful of its manipulation) design.<br /><br />If we can just find a means here in this innovation to keep our opinions short, concise, enlightening and applicable..<br />================<br />Hmmm, Perhaps you could divide your participants into two classes of thoughts; Like, one group (A) makes the strong and concise statement, charge, accusation, or Question ( i guess)?<br /><br />Group (B)Defends (A)s position statement and Group (C)takes an adversarial position to A and B.. ( you end up with a 3 way circle discussion)<br /><br />Now, If we agree that mostly all things man does is simply, construct, destruct(deconstruct), or reconstruct one thing or another, <br />then, <br />we agree that most of that comes from one competing thought against another competing thought and its winning thought outcome.. <br /><br />and Further, if we agree that all thoughts can be divided into good , bad, or evil, <br />and the more compex the thought or problem is, then the more competing thoughts we need to discern as to wether the winning competing thought is good, bad or evil;<br /> <br /> Then it stands to reason that by your having this site you and we are able to expose more complex bodies of competing thoughts for problem solutions constructs to a much greater collective community or body of thoughts ( citizens) to find a greater good thought for resolution, service, or product. <br />((((And, natually, people like me who would talk all day if you let them would have to be reigned in..humor kinda Or another site for extended thought meanderers.)))<br />(((OR yes no survey e.g. HEY PAUL, --Yes or No only -- WE SHOULD GO DIRECTLY INTO VW LIKE models of ELECTRICAL, compressed air, water, and magnetic field propelled VEHICLE PRODUCTIONS for home and personal use NOW. Just as we did with cable bands, tv. etc.))<br />In closing, <br />Anyway, can i go back and change my comments of Being open about all of the information on life essential Energies Needs use data, because this is very important.. and the Health Insuance because i dont think i made my case clearly<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Because if a thought is not clear minded in its intentions,description and application context.. Well, That thought then moves us to take a position based upon a limited view or without all of the needed things to be considered. hence, a distraction, or no discovery of thoughts in common to build.<br /><br /> </div><br />	Paul D.

3408-4049	Reform patriot Act Section 215, Think of Tommy Chong	2009-05-26 00:00:00	What is Section 215? <br /><br />Section 215 allows the FBI to order any person or entity to turn over "any tangible things," so long as the FBI "specif[ies]" that the order is "for an authorized investigation . . . to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities." <br />Section 215 vastly expands the FBI's power to spy on ordinary people living in the United States, including United States citizens and permanent residents. <br />The FBI need not show probable cause, nor even reasonable grounds to believe, that the person whose records it seeks is engaged in criminal activity. <br />The FBI need not have any suspicion that the subject of the investigation is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power. <br />The FBI can investigate United States persons based in part on their exercise of First Amendment rights, and it can investigate non-United States persons based solely on their exercise of First Amendment rights. <br /><br />For example, the FBI could spy on a person because they don't like the books she reads, or because they don't like the web sites she visits. They could spy on her because she wrote a letter to the editor that criticized government policy. <br />Those served with Section 215 orders are prohibited from disclosing the fact to anyone else. Those who are the subjects of the surveillance are never notified that their privacy has been compromised. <br />If the government had been keeping track of what books a person had been reading, or what web sites she had been visiting, the person would never know. <br />*If you think this is just about library books your wrong. The FBI regularly conducts sneak and peeks without any explanation. Another great tactic these trained federal agents use is entering a home or building and destroying everything inside, they may have a warrant specifying what they are there for but it doesn't matter, they will take or break everything but! These Agents to get to whom ever will threaten wifes, children, parents, anyone regardless to get cooperation from a person, doesn't matter what they have or have not done. <br />Is Section 215 Constitutional? <br /><br />Normally, the government cannot effect a search without obtaining a warrant and showing probable cause to believe that the person has committed or will commit a crime. <br />Section 215 violates the Fourth Amendment by allowing the government to effect Fourth Amendment searches without a warrant and without showing probable cause. <br />The violation of the Fourth Amendment is made more egregious by the fact that Section 215 might be used to obtain information about the exercise of First Amendment rights. For example, the FBI could invoke Section 215 to require a library to produce records showing who had borrowed a particular book or to produce records showing who had visited a particular web site. <br />Section 215 might also be used to obtain material that implicates privacy interests other than those protected by the First Amendment. For example, the FBI could use Section 215 to obtain medical records. <br />The provision violates the First Amendment by prohibiting those served with Section 215 orders from disclosing that fact to others, even where there is no real need for secrecy. <br />The provision violates the First Amendment by effectively authorizing the FBI to investigate U.S. persons, including American citizens, based in part on their exercise of First Amendment activity, and by authorizing the FBI to investigate non-U.S. persons based solely on their exercise of First Amendment activity. <br />The provision violates the Fourth and Fifth Amendments by failing to require that those who are the subject of Section 215 order's be told that their privacy has been compromised. <br />Thank you ACLU<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The government already has the authority to prosecute anyone whom it has probable cause to believe has committed or is planning to commit a crime. It also has the authority to engage in surveillance of anyone whom it has probable cause to believe is a foreign power or spy - whether or not the person is suspected of any crime. <br /><br />Section 215 takes away a great deal of our liberty and privacy but isn't likely to get us any security in return. <br /><br />There's a real possibility that setting the FBI loose on the American public will have a profound chilling effect on public discourse. If people think that their conversations and their e-mails are their reading habits are being monitored, people will inevitably feel less comfortable saying what they think, especially if what they think is not what the government wants them to think. <br /><br />For more information go to ACLU.org</div><br />	quarzacc	103	106	3	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3408-4049	
3409-4049	Transparency for Government, Privacy for Citizens	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Transparency should empower citizens to expose the inner workings of government, not empower the government to spy on its citizens. Several widely-used Internet technologies allow companies to track users as they surf the Web for the purpose of serving personalized, relevant advertisements. Even though many online services and applications may appear "free," users actually support these services by permitting providers to collect, store, and monetize their personal information.<br /><br />On government sites, the OMB determined in 2003 that tracking and profiling visitors could endanger civil liberties, and strictly limited these practices. The government remains interested in data-mining information about citizens' online activities. In 2005, for instance, the Department of Justice served Google with a subpoena for "all queries that have been entered on your company's search engine" during a specified period of time. The company fought this subpoena, however, a number of telecommunications companies granted the government unprecedented access to traffic on their networks.<br /><br />As the administration integrates private technologies, such as YouTube videos, into transparency Web sites, companies are using this opportunity to place tracking files onto visitors' computers. No taxpayer should be forced to submit to any form of tracking, merely for visiting a government site and accessing public information. Any files placed on a user's computer must expire at the end of a session, and should not be permitted to indefinitely track which sites that user visits on the Internet.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	dballon	82	84	2	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3409-4049	
3410-4049	Establishing a statutory rate for mobile multimedia will pave the way to growth in that sector.	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Internet digitization and peer2peer file sharing are the main culprits in the huge loss of sales for the photography industry, recording companies and other multimedia industries. If those industries would have stood together as "multimedia" when the Internet was young they could have lobbied to get Congress to put a statutory rate on ALL multimedia downloads from the Internet. The collective would have then worked out amongst themselves how to share the pie. Congress would have loved to have such a simple growth providing solution for so many all at once. Instead we have seen fragmented and complicated attempts to amend existing laws to try and keep up with the many issues technology has brought about. Congress is getting inundated with bill proposals from a variety of concerned special interest groups threatened by tech innovations.<br />Data infrastructures, data applications and data products are the new frontier. Now is the time to establish a statutory rate in this measurable new space that will provide a new revenue stream for the creative community that has tremendous growth potential. The players would first have to see themselves as one, "multimedia players". Now they are ready to go to Congress to get that statutory rate on ALL multimedia transacted peer2peer, mobile2mobile, consumer2consumer. Simplifying Congress's job. After all, why should the wireless industry profit from the sending and receiving of multimedia they do NOT control without giving copyright owners a fair share of the pie? datarevenue.org has details.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It will monetize the peer2peer exchanges for the creative community within the mobile space. If unchecked, peer2peer mobile exchanges will destroy the growth potential for the creative community as it has done on the Internet.</div><br />	vfi	-10	2	12	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3410-4049	
3411-4049	Taxation With Representation	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Federal, state and local income or sales taxes, if paid by individuals not corporations, should be directly allocated when they are paid. The burden of taxation should be redirected to corporations and lifted from individuals who pay an undue amount of taxes. Each tax form should include a last page illustrating how the previous year's taxes were spent by category and allowing the taxpayer to indicate the percentage of tax they want allocated by category or to establish a new category. This could be done for allocation of taxes two years ahead to give time to make the budget transparent and to allow referendums to restore critical funding or allocated emergency funds for the unforeseen, but it should not be altered by legislation alone nor by judicial review unless it violated some clear Constitutional intent. I am sure that even a public poll on these lines at tax time would result in a tax pie significantly different than the one created by their "representatives" in their voting records for allocations or the one created by executive action and design.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Taxes are misspent and do not reflect popular will. The many pay and the few allocate, putting power into the hands of an elite in what should be a more direct democracy. Direct allocation of tax reflects the democratic ideal of popular rule of government. This would be direct communication and feedback from people to those sworn to carry out their demands. People might make mistakes, but they would be quicker to fix them. This empowers people and will mean taxation with real representation. As Jefferson asked of those who felt people unable to govern themselves, why then did they feel competent to govern them instead.</div><br />	copa	9	17	8	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3411-4049

3419-4049	Protecting Stimulus Funds from Fraud Waste and Abuse	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Cooperation between federal agencies and between federal, state, and local governments will be important to combat Fraud, Waste and Abuse of stimulus funds. Governments should implement an effective business process and proven solutions to capture and analyze the allegations that are received across government agencies and the GAO FraudNet from private citizens, contractors, and government workers. Integration between systems would allow a broader view of allegations and cases to help spot trends to proactively protect funds.<br /><br />The type of service that is recommended requires both fraud and abuse (functional) and information technology (technical) expertise and a proven web-based solution to:<br />1. Automate the collection of allegations from multiple hotline sources and formats into one fraud case management system; <br />2. Analyze the allegations to identify patterns and trends and to determine which cases need to be investigated through the use of sophisticated data mining and business intelligence tools; and <br />3. Manage not only the operational and technical processes, but the business processes to quickly assemble comprehensive information, review allegations and adjudicate cases. Allegations can be converted into cases manually or immediately upon entry through a rules-based engine. The workflow capabilities assign cases to investigators for follow-up, provide alerts and notifications and track the audit history. The entire investigative process can be automated and allows agencies to investigate, create, manage, track and collaborate on cases, including support for criminal, civil and administrative resolutions. Reporting and data matching within a single agency and/or across agencies to evaluate potential fraud and abuse is achieved by managing the data in one or multiple and interoperable data warehouses. <br /><br />Alerts and notifications are required to identify early problems and non-obvious relationships and predictive analytics are needed to target and prevent potential fraud, waste and abuse.

3421-4049	Empower a Transition Taskforce	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Creating an Economic and Political Taskforce<br /><br />A useful project for AmeriCorps citizens to work on together (I wholeheartedly support the call for meaningful work projects, not just offering stories and sharing views) is creating an economic and political transition taskforce.<br /><br />Mission of the Transition Taskforce:<br />#1 Close Failed Banks and Investment Firms<br /><br />The mission of the transition taskforce will first be to oversee closure of the major banks and Wall Street investment firms that have failed (if they got a government bailout, they failed), and to prosecute the executives who have criminal liability for mismanaging funds.<br /><br />#2 Investigate and Prosecute Corrupt Government Officials<br /><br />Then the Transition Taskforce will be authorized to investigate corruption in elected government officials at all levels, to pursue criminal prosecution where appropriate, and to oversee elections to replace these officials. These elections are to be transparent and fair to ensure that every vote is counted fairly. International monitors should be welcomed at these elections to ensure that they are carried out democratically, freely and fairly.<br /><br />#3 Create a Harmonious International Monetary System: End the Hegemony of the U.S. Dollar<br /><br />While the housecleaning is being carried out, the transition team could initiate a number of projects to be worked on in a collaborative manner (with people participating from countries all over the world), to create an international monetary system that addresses the issues facing everyone, of living in harmony with our environment and each other. In the pursuit of fairness, an equitable forgiveness of debts and trade agreements could be negotiated using currency swaps instead of continuing the use of the U.S. dollar as the world's foreign currency reserve.<br /><br />Using Technology to Involve Everyone in the Discussion<br /><br />This could easily be done in a number of ways, stimulating discussion by people all over the world to come up with a better system for everyone. (The United States cannot make policy today as though it were in geographical isolation. We are one planet, and the U.S. needs to get it together with other people.) Many platforms and media could be used to carry on these discussions and facilitate decision-making, not only the Internet and face to face on Skype or other such programs, but also through podcasts and videos. There could be even be transitional television and radio programs with people coming in live to put in their two cents worth.<br /><br />Transition Team Guides Global Brainstorming Session<br /><br />This process has to be open discourse, with everyone jumping in and having their say. Every idea should be considered. This brainstorming session needs to go on for a good while, several months at least, before the taskforce moves to the next transitional phase of consensus building.<br /><br />Identify People Who Excel at Consensus Building<br /><br />Consensus building must have great people involved who are really skilled at getting people on the same page with very different ideas and approaches to problems. Are there any people capable of doing this in the entire planet? Perhaps there could be a contest, a highly publicized one, in which trial balloons are floated and people are given a chance to see what they can do. The winners of the contest would be given paid positions to carry out the consensus building phase of creating new systems. This would necessarily involve people from many different countries.<br /><br />We cannot look to any one leader or even political party or even one country alone to address the problems that we face today. This is an effort that must involve anyone who is willing to apply themselves to the work ahead of us, to steward our planet and have a good world of sufficient supplies, in order for everyone in the world and for all of our children to enjoy a good life.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	libertyferall	4	10	6	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3421-4049

3425-4049	A Democratic Military	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Some will say that a democratic military is an oxymoron or a contradiction in terms. But, that is because we have not critically examined our military, why it exists, it's purpose and it's place in the society. The US military belongs to all of us, acts in our name and we suffer or gain from the consequences of what it does. Millions of people participate in the military and their families are effected. However, the military as currently constituted does not reflect the values of a democratic society, despite the fact that enlisted members swear to defend the Constitution and believe they are fighting for democracy and the rights of others. Training, discipline and structure are central to military operations, or any operation, but they do not require the current draconian and Prussian military model we have in this country. To say we need a military is not to say we need this one, especially when it has an obsolete authoritarian structure and privileges. No other industrialized nation has an internal military judicial system, for example, nor do they ban unions. Our military does not reflect in practice the principles of the Constitution, the Nuremberg principles and other treaties, covenants and accords on warfare, and often violates international law and breaches Posse Comitatus and other barriers between military and police or civilian functions. We should create a military that respects and reflects the democratic and modern values of our nation and there are simple ways to make this happen in a dynamic way that takes the future into account. A democratic military will also be less of a force for constant warfare. Congress, the legislature and the courts should work together to ensure the following changes:<br /><br />1 - Insure that decisions about military personnel are transparent, open to Congressional and court review and public input and debate, and that the rights of enlistees, active and reserve members, veterans and their families are truly respected and that accountability and advocacy are established by independent non-military civilian review and appeal processes. <br />2 - Own our military as a nation. Begin a national and open debate about the nature, purpose, size and budget of the military as well as how it treats anyone who is part of it. These decisions cannot be made behind closed doors.<br />3 - Repeal the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the internal military judicial system of courts and prisons and provide civilian court review, fines or imprisonment for violations of civilian law. Eliminate line officer non-judicial punishments including fines, bust in rank, imprisonment, extra duty and grades of discharge.<br />4 - Require honest recruitment, no quality standard waivers, promises made in writing on the enlistment agreement treated as equivalent to contracts, immediate and voluntary discharge based on recruiter misrepresentation or fraud, and an established period of at least 180 days during with either the enlistee or the military can voluntarily effect a discharge without characterization or benefits, but not without real and documented cause on the part of the military. Provide transportation to home of record in these cases. Also require discharge or reassignment of recruiters involved in two or more instances of misrepresentation. Enlistment should be open to all people who do not have disqualifying or severely limiting physical or mental conditions or age limitations. Gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve and not be segregated in the military. All military jobs and advancement or benefits should be equitable and open to all regardless of gender or race or sexual orientation, and not determined by a biased test taken at point of entry. The true test should be performance of those tasks. Do not make quota requirements incumbent on any individual recruiter or command, but on changes in policy, benefits, retention, or other related issues.<br />5 - Eliminate punitive discharges of all kinds or any characterization of service. If information of a negative nature is retained in the record or for re-enlistment purposes, it must be considered private and not released even upon waiver to anyone but the enlisted member or next of kin if they are deceased. Eliminate any right to discriminate in hiring or other treatment or benefits based on past grade or characterization of discharge and do not allow employers to ask for that information.<br />6 - All military service should be truly voluntary and applying for any discharge should be able to be initiated by the enlisted member with documentation or by the military with the performance record or other information that is verifiable over time and not created at the end of term of service. Discharges should be easy to obtain with a loss of benefits proportional to time served. There should not be any "stop loss" policy allowed that blocks discharges. Discharge decisions should be resolved within at least 30 days of application, with independent appeal rights. The government should ensure equally beneficial options for civilian employment and meet minimal survival needs of people so that a poverty draft does not prevail. No return to conscripted military service should be considered or allowed. Civilian court review of habeus corpus should be automatic and encouraged and courts should give no special status to military commanders or their decisions, and common standards should apply.<br />7 - All participation in the military, in war and in particular wars should be fully voluntary. The rights of conscience regarding war in general, particular wars and even regarding orders considered illegal or immoral during combat, and adherence to Nuremberg principles and other internationally recognized articles and covenants of war and the rules of war, should be recognized and respected without punitive action or recrimination in the case of refusal of duty or of orders. John Kennedy said, "War will exist until the distant day when conscientious objectors are held in same respect as warriors are today." That day should no longer be distant, and we have current examples of the cost of violating international treaties and covenants and breaking the rules of war. This would also insure that pre-emptive, immoral, illegal or ill-guided wars would be less likely to be carried out as long as full and open debate and information guided civilian and military opinion about them. Thus, selective objection would not lead automatically to discharge, but would ensure assignment to compatible duties and prevent improper mobilization. These rights must be respected equally in peacetime and during conflicts because the objections most commonly arise during the practice of war, or sometimes only afterwards when integration of conscience is more difficult. Conscientious objectors to military service, all war, any war and any order should be recognized and accommodated in their stated beliefs regardless of timing and without requirement of proof of sincerity or sanity, as is now the case. Also the laws of war and the principles of conscience should be required to be explained and discussed prior to any enlistment so that we have a military of conscientious participators or we don't have enough troops to fight a war that violates conscience and law alike. If the reasons for going into a particular war are revealed to have been wrong or intentionally misleading, then a renewed decision about participation in that war should be allowed and encouraged. Right of appeal of any discharge decision should go outside military chain of command and allow automatic civilian court review if needed. Objectors should be immediately reassigned to duties that do not conflict with their stated beliefs until the discharge is resolved or appeals exhausted. Any order directly countermanding a prima facie statement of objection should be considered illegal.<br />8 - Military members and their families should have the right to dissent, protest and organize to improve their safety or working conditions and enlisted members and officers should have the right to form separate unions outside the military command. Unions should have the right to collective bargaining over work related issues and demands with the command once recognized and freely joined by the enlisted members or officers. Family members and others should have the right to dissent and protest conditions of enlisted members without being fined or jailed as under current federal laws. Military members should have the right to free speech, to petition, to distribution of materials, to assembly and to protected methods of appeals for redress and Congressional intervention. Enlisted members should have unrestricted rights of association with unions and other non-military organizations concerned with their rights.<br />9 - Punitive discharges arising from past courts martial decisions should be expunged, and records of such criminal convictions should be private save in the case of crimes of violence or sexual assault that would require reporting and disclosure in civilian convictions. Transfer to long-term civilian facilities should be arranged for felony-level cases being held at Ft. Leavenworth brig or elsewhere for terms of six-months or longer and then military prisons should be closed and eliminated at the end of six-months as people end their sentences and depart the facilities. All subsequent crimes that would normally fall under civilian prosecution should be immediately referred to civilian jurisdiction with transfer of the individual to such custody or cognizance as the civilian arraignment would assign.<br />10 - Codes of conduct within the military structure and society would be redrawn and clearly spelled out, with democratic input from enlisted members and the public, and enforced by discharge, denial of promotion, or counseling, training and voluntary correction if they were serious and disruptive. A complete review of all the articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice should be undertaken, eliminating all those that are already covered by civilian law and treaty and those that restrict Constitutional rights and human rights recognized nationally and internationally. A balanced and democratic code should emerge that protects rights and equally limits the bad conduct of officers and enlisted members.<br />11 - Instances of discrimination or abuse in the military based on criteria of age, race, gender, sexual orientation, or any other factor besides actual performance would not be tolerated, would allow an independent review and appeal process with no recrimination for claims, and would result not only in correction of wrongs done to the individual but in consequences for the officer or person involved in the discriminatory practices. Beyond this individual level of claims, all discharges would be reviewed with this in mind, initiated by either officer or enlisted, and a demographically consistent rate of enlistment, discharge, promotion and assignment would reflect if not improve on the distribution that exists in the society as a whole. An independent non-military agency should be created to both collect and decide on complaints, do the reviews, and suggest policies of recruitment, retention and treatment in practice that would make sure the military at all levels promoted equality of opportunity not privilege.<br />12 - Benefits and promises should be guaranteed without exceptions to those who fulfill the terms of their agreement once they are discharged. This includes medical and other treatment for those harmed or injured or whose medical conditions worsened as a result of military duty, training or combat, with a much less hostile interpretation of whether the condition is linked to their military service or easily related to possible chemical or radiation exposure in the battlefield regardless of symptoms or previous conditions before entry. Clear breach of promise during enlistment should be grounds for discharge plus fair proportional compensation for time served, and denial after discharge of promised benefits should be grounds for civilian suits for recompense. The existing Feres doctrine, disallowing legal claims against the military for medical or other malpractice injury should be eliminated entirely, making the military accountable. Again, independent medical evaluations during and at the end of military service should be facilitated to help make these decisions about need for treatment for all related conditions.<br />13 - Leadership in the military command structure, especially in the combat operations, should be a combination of military training and advancement and of mutually agreed respect from the troops under any command. Some military forces elect their officers without ill effect, for instance. A certain level of discharge requests, discrimination claims, and other forms of complaint (petition, redress of grievance, Congressional inquiries, and troop assessments) should be criteria in a command for replacing that leadership in a quick fashion, for discharge, retraining or reassigment as appropriate. Something like a political vote of confidence should be taken among troops being led into any combat situation prior to a final appointment<br />14 - The public must be given a voice and a choice, just as much as the enlisted are, in what sorts of wars the US will participate in, regardless of how they are declared or sanctioned by Congress. Wars should be the result of referendums, as should be any military response even in a crisis situation. Clear alternatives should be discussed and proposed in open debate for a public decision at the start and during any combat operations and standards for military action or reaction should be reviewed and reset in a democratic way.<br />15 - Militarization of the society, through excessive profits for defense and weapons contracts, denial of critical domestic needs by a bloated military budget, excessive size and global distribution of military troops requiring large levels of enlistment due to function and to lack of retention and turnover, combat training that does not retrain for civilian life and reduce violent tendencies, destruction of families and individuals through excessive stress in combat due to the nature of the combat, glorification of war and militarism as a mark of manhood or cultural adulthood in movies, toys and advertisements, recruitment and a constant military presence in middle and high schools, revolving participation in both military and corporate leadership regarding contracts and weapon development, involvement of the public in wars both covert and open that violate rules of war and treaty, the rise of the military-industrial-intelligence complex and the national security and homeland security state since General Eisenhower warned about it, massive expenditure of resources, production and human and financial capital at an increasing rate since the beginning of the last century creating a permanent war economy, and the status of the military as an undemocratic and unequal institution within the society and reflected abroad, as a sacred cow that cannot be questioned or changed, must be countered and ended.<br />16 - The rise of a massive military intelligence structure and apparatus, the Defense Intelligence Agency with all it's extensions in various military branches, NSA, satellite reconnaisance and mapping, and security commands, its encroachment on police function and militarization of police, plans for Continuity of Government and martial law, privatization of military function, surveillance, esperimentation and spying on civilians since the early 1900s with databases on a majority of Americans, its functions under NORTHCOM which regards the United States as a battle command area, and it's control of 85% of the intelligence budget as well as command over massive covert operations here and abroad, threatens the country and the Constitution and dominates domestic, foreign, global and even space policy and militarization. It does this with virtually no oversight regarding even its legal right to exist, it's secret budget, its Black Ops, it's violations of law and assassination activities, its ability to define and expand its own powers, its addition to the secrecy surrounding critical issues and decisions, its extensions into civilian life and politics, and its impunity through virtual invisibility to the public at large. It is far past time for oversight, transparency and review that reveals its history, structure and expansion, replacement of civilian function, domination of all intelligence agencies and matters, and its reining in and dismantling to controllable and accountable size and disclosure, not to mention function. The DIA is without question the least democratic and Constitutional of all the institutions in society, and the least known, visible or accountable. It is time to bring it into public view and regulate its function and question its purpose and methods.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>War and military powers and functions, according to Hamilton and other founders, carried the gravest threat of executive engrandizment and abuse and danger to democracy itself. General Eisenhower warned in 1960 of a military-industrial complex rising that would counter democracy and have undue influence on the whole society and on the budget. A permanent war economy guts the industrial base and the democratic traditions of our society at the same time. It is critical then that military size, function, budget, function and personnel issues are transparent and matters for public input and debate in a time when the courts and the Congress are not likely to challenge their supremacy in making those decisions behind closed Pentagon or corporate doors. Oversight alone cannot counter a faulted structure and function. We have to own our military. Saying we need one does not mean we need this one as it is unchanged and unchallenged. Tens of millions of veterans and military family members know what is wrong with military personnel policy. Decisions about war cannot be left to an elite, nor can decisions about the alternatives to it. Public will about wars is ignored before they are started and totally discounted after they begin, with dreadful and undemocratic consequences, especially to those called to fight them. An American military should be a democratic military, one that reflects the true values of freedom, democracy and individual rights, one that honors those that are members by protecting their rights, keeping them from unnecessary combat and harm, and honoring their service with honest enlistment, fair treatment, Constitutional rights, and discharge options and benefits that can be relied on. The rights of military family members should also not be diminished as they often are regarding assignments, duties, participation in combat, and working conditions. The public should own its military and decide what they want that military to do on their behalf. If we do not democratize our military we will continue to militarize our democracy and participate in wars that threaten ecocide, ethnocide and genocide due to the weapons and level of civilian death, toxicity and destruction of the planet. </div><br />	copa	5	15	10	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3425-4049

3427-4049	Could the general public be better served if a new perspective were examined with respect to maintaining US federal highways?	2009-05-26 00:00:00	For example, before the Interstates these roads were the main arteries or as we expressed it "the way-to-go-to-town" . . . a genuine, U.S. federally funded and maintained four-lane, media-divided (sometimes landscaped) super-highway. But the well-maintained older, federal highway system is fast becoming a public nuisance and dangerous.<br /><br />In recognition of the immediate need to preserve the scenic landscape -- forests, natural cliffs and flowing streams -- along side these older highways that are being devoured more and more each day that passes. . . swallowed up in some kind of "scorched-earth" approach to developments, where topsoil and trees and undergrowth are bulldozed away w/o regard to the destruction of the natural scene.<br /><br />Therefore, for the public good, health and safety concerns, we recommend that the U. S. federal highway should serve as a "transportation corridor" foremost and that private investment in development alongside these federal highways should be fairly compensated through eminent domain law so that the continuing commercial wall can be soft-scape buffered from the view of passing motorists similar to the way US Interstate System is today. Private property owners could ingress and egress from services roads parallel to the highway. Doing so would necessitate the following:<br /><br />1. Purchase a 500 ft right-of-way from the middle of the US federal highway median on each side in order to limit direct access from the myriad death-traps that now front it;<br />2. Conduct a pilot road project designed to place unsightly, electrical infrastructure either underground or behind this 500ft buffer as the service roads are being constructed; and a service road parallel to those US federal highways participating; <br />3. Offer access at existing intersections from the federal hwy to the residential & commercial outlets and along the newly built infrastructure-service road corridor; and<br />4. Promotes the original intention of and intended value of overcoming time/distance constraints from working in the city core while living in a surrounding region.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Over and above its obvious use as a transportation corridor, a number of older U.S. Federal Highways - constructed pre-WWII like the old Florida Short Route through Birmingham (today's US 280), could serve the general public better if a new perspective were examined. </div><br />	educare	2	9	7	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3427-4049

Do not promise anything. Just let them volunteer. They will gain knowledge, they will learn how the system works and maybe if they are really good they may be haired. This would be a good for all the people who are looking for a part time job, that has very flexible hours and do not want to stay out of the loop. This is extremly true for moms. There needs to be rooles in place to avoid the office taking advantage of free work and let people know that there is no garantee they will be hired. It can be good also for graduate to start a carrer. It is so frustrating answering job post where they always require 1-2 years of experience. No one wants to train anymore.<br />I'm a mom, from Italy. Naturalized american. I was a Veterinarian in Italy, but here they do not recognize my degree and my 3 years of experience in food safety. There is a big need of Veterinarians to keep what we eat safe. Many times when I go in restourants I look in the kitchens and then I leave, they are so discusting. With such a kitchen the restourant will be closed down in Italy. I would love to work here in USA. But first I need to find the money and the time to go back to school (not easy with 2 little kids and the school at 2 hrs from my town) or I need to take a test about all veterinary science (as if I just came out of my university), while I'm already specialized on something very limited. So more or less deciding on my american husband was like deciding to stop my career. I wish things could be different for the future.

There will be an explicit follow-up process to facilitate ongoing cooperation among participants resulting in subsequent transpartisan activity under multiple banners. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Policy makers need creative, win/win policy options to address complex challenges. Progressives talking to progressives create solutions that do not work for mainly progressives. It takes all political points of view engaged in deep dialogue with safe ground rules to achieve a quality of conversation that rises to the level of win/win. To deal with the level of complexity of challenges facing America will require authentically transpartisan, whole-system thinking.<br /><br />Reference: http://transpartisan.net</div><br />	jmccormick	10	15	5	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3430-4049

3438-4049	Building A Minority Public Participation Agenda	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Background<br /><br />The state of Maryland has experienced tremendous growth and prosperity over the past decade. During this time, Maryland has led the nation in employment growth and has become one of the wealthiest states in the country. On indicators ranging from median income to unemployment to advanced education degrees, the great state of Maryland leads the region with remarkable consistency. It is also a major player in broadening environmental awareness as a result of its national treasure, The Chesapeake Bay. <br /><br />While poverty has decreased over the past 20 years according to the Maryland Alliance for the Poor (MAP), the Family Investment Administration (FIA) continues to report a significant number of minority families falling well below federal poverty levels in at least 11 of Maryland's 24 jurisdictions and health disparities at alarming rates are being reported as a result of the state of the environment. Yet no federal or state guidelines or legislation has been enacted to encourage minority environmental responsibility.<br /><br />While the health of the Chesapeake Bay, its tributaries and overall environment has significantly declined, the number of people living in poverty has significantly increased, significant geographic differences in wealth and employment patterns have continued to emerge, and no federal or state guidelines or legislation to stimulate collaborative environmental responsibility for the Chesapeake Bay, its tributaries and the overall environment of our communities. <br /><br />If we don't act now to include all citizens, these differences can only widen the gap as planners predict increased air, land and water pollution, increased urban sprawl and population growth, and few and fewer stakeholders exercising their environmental responsibility to help restore the Bay and our environment.<br /><br />Over the next two decades, the region is projected to generate more than 1.6 million new jobs and gain more than 1.5 million new residents, including many new immigrants, African-Americans and retired seniors who will join those that settled here in the last decade.<br /><br />This future growth provides a unique opportunity to narrow the distance between those currently involved in Bay restoration efforts and those we need on board to help. However, our success in closing this gap will depend on how well the many jurisdictions and organizations in the region can work together to create more collaborative opportunities. It will also require strengthened civic participation to ensure that all of the people who are affected by the environment are included in the forums and processes that guide the region's restoration of the environment.<br /><br /> <br />Moving Forward<br /><br />Across the country, foundations, nonprofit organizations, government leaders, business executives, members of the faith-based community and concerned citizens are engaged in creating greater "regional efforts" When it comes to environmental responsibility. Environmental responsibility, as defined by the national nonprofit organization the Chesapeake Bay Foundation looks at the impact of damage to the environmental and the total health of Maryland communities and outcomes and impacts of low-income people and communities of color that are uninformed about their civic responsibility to help mitigate the problems plaguing the Bay and our environment. This emerging field challenges those working to affect change at the neighborhood level to recognize the impact that decisions about environmental responsibility throughout the region has on the lives of low-income families as well as community partners, and to actively work to engage residents in the processes that shape these decisions. Those active in this field identify a number of issue areas that impact environmental responsibility: The areas are:<br /><br />- Economic Opportunity<br />- Education<br />- Environmental Justice<br />- Health<br />- Housing<br />- Land Use and Infrastructure<br />- Transportation<br /><br />Leaders in the national environmental restoration movement are creating broad-based alliances focused on regional agendas to address these factors and to stimulate greater civic participation in the processes that influence equity outcomes.<br /><br />In the state of Maryland, a significant number of organizations have emerged as interested parties in minority environmental responsibility conversations. Nearly 10 state agencies, legislators, businesses and other community partners have indicated their interests. Many regional groups have also surfaced, and have a strong interest in developing a coalition actively working together to strengthen efforts to restore the Bay.<br /><br /><br />The Agenda<br /> <br />Our long-term goal: To increase participation in environmental restoration in general and the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries in particular and reduce the disparities in the environmental community.<br /><br />To accomplish this goal, we have agreed that there are a number of objectives we need to pursue. But our starting point is to begin to connect groups working toward similar outcomes but with disparate efforts and provide them with the supports to learn, improve their effectiveness, strengthen their relationships and build partnerships and coalitions for change.<br />Our objectives: <br />1. To build a network of organizations that are working to create greater collaborations in the context of environmental responsibility.<br />2. Define and work towards a set of specific near-term initiatives that increase the commitment of regional leaders in restoration efforts and have minority participation in environmental responsibility at the center of state and regional priorities. <br /><br />Target audiences: Regional opinion leaders and organizations working on some aspect of environmental and community health, housing, transportation and equity. Includes public, private, philanthropic and nonprofit stakeholders.<br /><br />The Project/Initiative will:<br /><br />Cultivate leaders throughout the state to be advocates for environmental responsibility. Participants will seek to cultivate key leaders throughout the state to endorse state-wide and regional work actively to correct health, economic and social disparities in the environmental clean-up process.<br /><br />Develop a statement of principles for achieving increased minority participation. Use the statement of principles as a clear first step towards building civic agreement and commitment to cleaning up neighborhoods, waterways, properties (public and private) and the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Seek prominent elected officials, opinion leaders and business leaders as signatories to signal the importance of collective environmental responsibility to the health and vibrancy of the Chesapeake Bay and the entire region. <br /><br />Identify several specific projects, investments, and/or policies that would create greater partnering in environmental restoration efforts throughout the state.<br /><br />Promote collaboration with each other and with other individuals and entities that are critical to making progress, including key stakeholders such as public officials, business leaders, developers, foundations and individual donors, government representatives, faith community leaders, etc. Over time, this group could become a resource for groups looking to have more "community voice and participation" and to expand the clout of those groups working on the equity side of the "development conversation."<br /><br />Help groups share expertise and resources and leverage outside technical assistance for local groups. This would include groups providing technical and strategic assistance to each other on topics such as message framing, effective advocacy and community engagement, and linking local initiatives with broader regional agenda. <br /><br />Increase awareness of the environmental landscape in the state of Maryland in and around the Chesapeake Bay: data, players, convenings and forums, existing partnerships and coalitions, opportunities for strategic work, funding streams, etc. Participants will increase their knowledge of the different jurisdictions as well as the broader "regional picture". Participants will also learn about the efforts of other groups.<br /><br />Build capacity and knowledge about the developing field of environmental responsibility. The VESC will be a source of information on best practices for other environmental clean-up efforts underway throughout the country; resources from the Chesapeake Bay Trust, the Anne Casey Foundation, the Minority Environmental Land Trust and other national groups, and linkages to training and learning opportunities nationally. Participants will feel more connected to the national movement and be continually expanding their knowledge of effective practices and strategies.<br /><br />Stimulate relationship building with each other and with other individuals and entities that are critical to making progress. The VESC will plan and conduct its own events and publicize others where relationship building with key stakeholders can take place--public officials, business leaders, developers, funders and individual donors, government representatives, faith community leaders, etc.<br /><br /><br />Funding: Initial funding from the state would support an Executive Director to launch and guide the initiative during the one-year pilot phase. Additional funding will be secured to provide resources for members of the virtual facilities at local HBCUs, colleges and university to dedicate their time to the effort.<br /><br />Leadership Group: The role of the leadership group would be to work with a Executive Director to develop the statement of principles and secure endorsements from organizations and leaders in their community; to be the voices of the state-wide environmental responsibility; to cultivate local leaders to be advocates of state-wide environmental responsibility; to identify several specific projects, investments, and/or policies that would create greater social and economic equity in the region and that might serve as good collaborative initiatives for a large set of players; to bring organizations in their community into the initiative; and to generally serve as leaders of the effort. <br /> <br />Executive Director: The role of the Executive Director would be to build and support a leadership group; to help identify and recruit other players (organizations and individuals); to help the leadership group deliver on key issues/objectives; and to keep the effort moving forward.<br /><br />Specific responsibilities and deliverables for the Executive Director would include:<br />• Build a diverse leadership group of those willing to take on key pieces of the initiative;<br />• Help the leadership group and other participants define an initial list of collaborative initiatives;<br />• Support the leadership group in delivery of a few clear initiatives;<br />• Drive the process of developing a regional statement of principles that non-profit groups, philanthropy community, elected officials and business leaders could adopt; <br />• "Power-map" the state to identify key opinion leaders and decisions makers to target; <br />• Identify and recruit participants in the leadership group and broader network.<br />• Develop communications channels and materials for participants <br />• Schedule and staff learning opportunities and forums, including providing information about the equity situation in the region<br />• Facilitate networking and relationship-building opportunities<br />• Secure technical assistance resources <br />• Develop budget and assist with fundraising<br />• Coordinate external communications about the initiative and the efforts of its members<br />• Evaluate and report.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Minority public participation is essential to every major issues being discussed. We can not clean-up the Chesapeake Bay, the air or anything else, unless all citizens are actively involved and programs to include minority particpation is supported.</div><br />	donyamaria	8	13	5	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3438-4049

Those who are prosecuted and imprisoned, however, are by far and away the poor, the disabled, the disenfranchised, the Black and Hispanic, the men in our communities, who cannot parent their children because they are in prison, who will be denied forever the right to vote because they went to prison. The last President of the United States never denied that he used illegal drugs. Hard drugs. Was he prosecuted? Of course not. Was he imprisoned? Don't be silly. Was he denied the right to vote, or to contribute to society? Was he denied the ability to raise his children? Of course not. Has the "War on Drugs" created a "drug-free" society? No. Has it kept drugs from the reach of our youngsters? Not remotely. Drugs are everywhere, as available as they have ever been. It has, however, created a society in which young Black men in America are far more likely to go to prison than to college. A society in which drugs and violence are on every corner. In which the police are powerless to do their job and have declared war on our communities and our children as a consequence. IN WHICH OUR CHILDREN HAVE MORE TO FEAR FROM THE POLICE THAN FROM GANGS AND DRUG DEALERS. The "War on Drugs" is killing us. The "War on Drugs" is a war on us.

3441-4049	Use internet 'Quick-votes' to let the public weigh-in on issues.	2009-05-26 00:00:00	The quick-votes (a la CNN style; see CNN.com) are a quick and convenient way to gauge where public opinion lies on existing issues to help drive policy.<br /><br />The idea is to be a decision-making aid for government. For example, suppose the President has a tough issue for which he must make a decision. He has various advisers tell him what what they know about the issue, the president himself will have his knowledge, his interests and the interests of his family in mind, and he will surely have the interests of the American people in mind. But what really IS the interest of the American people? Quick votes can be a way to obtain that and apply it to the decision making process. ie, it would be one more component the President can use to help make the right decision.<br /><br />Because a quick vote is so quick and convenient, the president can have a quick vote put on-line and 24 hours later, after, say, hundreds of thousands of people have given their vote, have a significant reading on which side of the issue the public is on (even if the vote is close, that's important to know as well - the people are split on the issue). As word gets out, popularity would probably soar as the media puts links on websites and people see how easy it is to weigh in and participate in government.<br /><br />Another application could be an "Issue of the day" just to continuously gauge the public's view on topics of the day. This could keep the public involved (both from a participatory and an observatory standpoint), and could become an important resource in guiding the creation of public policy.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It can be a quick non-binding way to get a feel for what the public wants on issues.

3443-4049	 Practical Democracy	2009-05-27 00:00:00	<br /><br /> To improve our nation's government and our society, we can no longer allow unknown politicians to select our political leaders. Instead, we must select them from among ourselves. We must insure they are the best of our people rather than the worst. In other words, our leaders must be selected FROM the people rather than FOR the people.<br /><br /> Our method must be democratic (i.e., allow the entire electorate to participate) and egalitarian (i.e., give everyone an equal chance to participate). The following sections describe a way to accomplish this while harnessing human nature by making probity a prime concern when evaluating potential representatives.<br /><br /> Although the process is continuous, I will describe it as having two phases. The human factors dominating the first phase will metamorphose into a different set of factors as the second phase develops. This metamorphosis is the 'magic' of the process; it makes virtue a valuable quality for aspiring candidates.<br /><br /><br />Selecting Leaders, Method<br /><br />1) Divide the electorate into groups of three people (triads).<br /><br />2) Assign a date and time by which each group must select one of<br /> the three to represent the other two.<br /><br /> a. No participant may vote for himself.<br /><br /> b. If a group is unable to select a representative in the<br /> specified time, the group is disqualified.<br /><br />3) Divide the participants so selected into groups of three.<br /><br />4) Repeat from step 2 until a target number of selections is<br /> reached.<br /><br /><br /><br />Selecting Leaders, Discussion (1)<br /><br /> An Election Commission conducts the process. It names the participants of each group and supplies the groups with the text of pending ordinances and a synopsis of the budget appropriate to the group. In addition, on request, it makes the full budget available and supplies the text of any existing ordinances. This insures a careful examination of public matters and encourages a thorough discussion of partisan views on matters of public concern.<br /><br /> For convenience, we refer to each iteration as a 'Level', such that Level 1 is the initial grouping of the entire electorate, Level 2 is the grouping of the selections made at Level 1, and so forth. The entire electorate participates at level 1 giving everyone an equal opportunity to advance to succeeding levels.<br /><br />* As the process advances through the levels, the amount of time the participants spend together increases. At level 1, groups may meet for a few minutes, over a back-yard fence, so-to-speak, but that would not be adequate at higher levels. As the levels advance, the participants need more time to evaluate those they are grouped with. They also need transportation and facilities for meeting and voting. These are mechanical details.<br /><br />* The public has a tendency to think of elections in terms of just a few offices: a congressional seat, a senate race, and so forth. There are, however, a large number of elected officials who fill township, county, state and federal offices. The structure outlined here provides qualified candidates for those offices.<br /><br /><br />Selecting Leaders, Partisanship<br /><br /> At any time up to one week before an election, voters may declare themselves to be members of any party and may create a new party, simply by declaring membership in it. Voters that do not declare party membership will automatically be assigned to a set of voters with no party affiliation. The Electoral Commission will create triads from members of the same party, as long as more than two members of a party advance. When less than three members of a party advance, the party's remaining candidates are merged with the no-party candidates. This allows elevation of partisan interests to the highest level supported by the party's membership. (Rules for handling overflow situations are omitted from this presentation.)<br /><br /><br />Selecting Leaders, Discussion (2)<br /><br /> The initial phase of the process is dominated by participants with little interest in advancing to higher levels. They do not seek public office; they simply wish to pursue their private lives in peace. Thus, the most powerful human dynamic during the first phase (i.e., Level 1 and for some levels thereafter) is a desire by the majority of the participants to select someone who will represent them. The person so selected is more apt to be someone who is willing to take on the responsibility of going to the next level than someone who actively seeks elevation to the next level, but those who do actively seek elevation are not inhibited from doing so.<br /><br /> As the levels increase, the proportion of disinterested parties diminishes and we enter the second phase. Here, participants that advance are marked, more and more, by an inclination to seek further advancement. Thus, a powerful human trait is integrated into the system.<br /><br /> Those who actively seek selection must persuade their group that they are the best qualified to represent the other two. While that is easy at the lower levels, it becomes more difficult as the process moves forward and participants are matched with peers who also wish to be chosen.<br /><br /> Each participant must make a choice between the other two people in the group knowing that they must rely on that person's integrity to guide their future actions and decisions. Since they are unable to control the person selected (except as otherwise provided to implement the bi-directionality mentioned below), they must choose the person they believe most likely to conduct public business in the public interest.<br /><br /> However, they do not make their choices blindly. Elections are a periodic process. The majority of those seeking advancement will do so each time the process recurs. Some will be successful. They will achieve public office and their performance will be a matter of public record. When they participate in subsequent occurrences of the process, their peers can evaluate that record to help them decide the candidate's suitability for advancement. Furthermore, the names of advancing candidates are announced as each level completes. Members of the public with knowledge of unseemly acts by an advancing candidate can present details for consideration at the next level. Since, after the initial levels, the peers also seek advancement, they won't overlook inappropriate behavior.<br /><br /> Face-to-face meetings in three-person groups eliminate any possibility of voting machine fraud. Significantly, they also allow participants to observe the non-verbal clues humans emit during discourse and will tend to favor moderate attitudes over extremism. The dissimulation and obfuscation that are so effective in media-based politics will not work in a group of three people, each of whom has a vital interest in reaching the same goal as the miscreant. Thus, the advancement of participants will depend on their perceived integrity as well as the probity with which they fulfill their public obligations.<br /><br /> This is a distillation process, biased in favor of the most upright and capable of our citizens. It cannot guarantee that unprincipled individuals will never be selected ... such a goal would be unrealistic ... but it does insure that they are the exception rather than the rule.<br /><br /> The process is inherently bi-directional. Because each elected official sits atop a pyramid of known electors, questions on specific issues can easily be transmitted directly to and from the electors for the guidance or instruction of the official.<br /><br /> The cost of conducting an election by this method is free to the participants, except for the value of their time, and minimal to the government. Thus, it removes the greatest single cause of corruption in our current system ... the need for campaign funds.<br /><br /><br />Selecting Leaders, Simplified Illustration<br /><br /> This table is built around a hypothetical election in a community with an electorate of 2,000 voters. For simplicity, we omit party considerations and assume each triad selects a candidate. The election is to produce a Mayor for the community, a Council member, and two candidates for state and national offices.<br /><br /> Selected<br /> Randomly<br /> From<br /> Full Previous Total People People<br />Level Candidates Triads Overflow Level Triads Selected Unselected<br /> 1 2000 666 2 666 666 1334<br /> 2 668 222 2 1 223 223 445 (1)<br /> 3 223 74 1 2 75 75 148<br /> 4 75 25 25 25 50<br /> 5 25 8 1 2 9 9 16 (2)<br /><br />(1) If the number of candidates does not divide equally into<br /> triads, any candidates remaining are overflow. Level 2 is a<br /> special case. When there is overflow from Level 1, the extra<br /> person(s) automatically become candidates at Level 2.<br /> Thereafter, when there is overflow at any level, the number<br /> of people needed to create a full triad are selected at<br /> random from the people who were not selected at the previous<br /> level.<br /><br />(2) The nine people selected at level 5 decide which of the nine<br /> will serve as Mayor, which will serve on the Council, and which<br /> will advance to compete for state and national offices.<br /><br /> To give a very rough idea of the time lapse required for such an election, we will hypothesize triad lives of 5 days for the 1st and 2nd levels, 12 days for the 3rd and 4th levels, 19 days for the 5th and 6th levels, and 26 days thereafter. For the example, that would work out something like this:<br /><br /> Level Start Report Days<br /> 1) 07/09/08 07/14/08 5<br /> 2) 07/16/08 07/21/08 5<br /> 3) 07/23/08 08/04/08 12<br /> 4) 08/06/08 08/18/08 12<br /> 5) 08/20/08 09/08/08 19<br /><br /> The 9 people selected at level 5, would start meeting on September 10th and make their selections by September 29th, 19 days later.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /> The idea presented here will be considered radical. It bears little chance of adoption because it protects no vested interest. The only way such a process will ever be adopted is if the concept can be made a topic of discussion, particularly among students interested in achieving a righteous government.<br /><br />Respectfully submitted,<br /><br />Fred L.

3448-4049	Use 501c3 non-profits and community-based groups as models for a new government culture	2009-05-27 00:00:00	How would you define the cultural change of Government? Should it become more like a Service Organization instead of a Governing Organization? (Question posed by Sam Mehrani on the "Create a government-wide culture of transparency, collaboration, and participation" item)<br /><br />My response to him:<br />I think that the government should use 501c3 non-profit organizations and community-based programs as a model for their culture, as well as some of their organizational structures and processes. I do a lot of work with these types of organizations and have always wondered why our governments couldn't act more like them. I single out 501c3 non-profits specifically because the one thing they are not allowed to do that the other main type of non-profit, a 501c6, can do is contribute to or advocate or campaign for any political party, cause, or candidate. The main workforce of the government is not elected or appointed, they are "civil servants", so they should not be partisan towards one side or the other on political issues. They should be there to serve the common good - period!<br /><br />I believe that the aspects of 501c3 non-profits and community-based groups that the government culture should emulate are:<br /><br />-- They are primarily focused on the good of their members/constituents and society as a whole. Although government was theoretically supposed to have the same purpose, we have seen quite the opposite in many cases, where the government acts mainly as a lawmaking and regulatory body and provides little if any real service to the people they represent and serve. So I think your suggestion to act more like a service organization rather than a governing organization is right on on the mark!<br /><br />-- They are volunteer based. Most of the major decisions and the actions taken as a result of the decisions are done by the members/constituents of the organization/group. The governance of these organizations is conducted by unpaid volunteers, supported by paid staff. For a non-profit org, this takes the form of a Board of Directors and usually some permanent committees and temporary task forces - all volunteers. The work of the organization is shared between paid staff and unpaid volunteers but in many non-profit organizations and community groups, the unpaid volunteers far outnumber the paid staff. In fact, in some smaller organizations and groups there are no paid staff, only volunteers. <br /><br />As Sam suggested, why couldn't the government act more like a service organization?<br />Why couldn't the government introduce the concept and practice of volunteerism and community/public-based governance into their culture like non-profits and community groups do?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea emerged from a dialogue in the "Create a government-wide culture of transparency, collaboration, and participation" item and seemed worthy of being its own separate idea. This idea would help to evolve the culture of the Federal government from primarily a governance culture - lawmaking and regulating, to a service culture where serving the common good becomes the "prime directive" of the government.</div><br />	Arian Ward	-7	5	12	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3448-4049	
3449-4049	H1B AND L-1 VISAS OR HOW TO PUT THE MIDDLE CLASS BACK TO WORK	2009-05-27 00:00:00	THE DAMAGE OF THE H1B AND L1B VISAS OR HOW TO PUT THE MIDDLE CLASS BACK TO WORK<br /><br />An H1B Visa is non immigrant visa in the US that allows employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. Typical H1B occupations include ARCHITECTS, ENGINEERS, PROGRAMMERS, ACCOUNTANTS, DOCTORS, BUSINESS MANAGERS AND COLLEGE PROFESSORS. There are currently hundreds of thousands of H1B employees who have replaced American workers, many of whom were forced to train their replacements in order to receive their earned severance package. Many of these Americans are now hard pressed to become employed again and stay employed without losing yet another job to an H1B Visa immigrant. It is said Americans do not want these jobs or cannot be found but the truth is that the Immigrants will work for less than the Americans and are contracted for 6 years. During this time some are trying to get their green card to continue on in America after their visa is up.<br />An L-1 Visa is generally for 3 years and is available to employees of an international company with offices in both a home country and the US. It allows foreign workers to relocate to the company's US offices for at least 1 year prior to being granted L-1 status. There is no quota system and is quite devastating to our economy and the middle class white collar worker. The spouses are allowed to work without restriction in the US. <br />Critics of the visa programs such as the Nobel Prize winning economist, Milton Friedman, referred to the program as a corporate subsidy because they are supposed to be paid the prevailing wages with safeguards in place. But the data from the US government OES office shows that these H1B wages are below the median for the same occupation as compared to a US worker. So this is how the corporations are being subsidized by the government. Or as Professor Norman Matloff, UC-Davis sums it up "its about cheap labor and there is no shortage of qualified American citizens to fill American computer related jobs". He further stated that the data offered as evidence by American corporations "needing" H1B and L-1 visas to address labor shortages, was erroneous. <br />The US General Accounting Office has also reported that the controls on the H1B visa program lacked effectiveness in 2000. <br />Almost any job in the US that requires one sit at a desk can be taken by an H1B visa worker. The original intent was to bring someone who had a very unique skill that could not be filled by most other people. But that intent has been lost and today the middle class is losing jobs at an alarming rate while also losing their buying power in the American economy. Wages have been driven down below 50% of what they were 5-8 years ago. The same IT job today is paying what it paid in 1988. The H1B workers cannot afford to replace the American buyers in the economy.<br />Our proposal is to end the H1B L-1 Visa Program and re-employ Americans who have the experience, skill and wisdom to do the jobs that have been taken from them. <br />HERE ARE SOME WEBSITES FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE SUBJECT.<br /> <br />WWW.JOBDESTRUCTION.COM/SHAMEH1B/JOBDESTRUCTIONNEWS.HTM<br /><br /><br />HTTP://WASHTECH.ORG<br /><br /><br />Professor Norman Matloff's H1B and Offshoring Webpage:<br />http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/H1B.html<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Almost any job in the US that requires one sit at a desk can be taken by an H1B visa worker.

3480-4049	Shifting decision making criteria from win/lose to ALL-win norms to build a world that works for all.	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The win/lose approach to life which results in the well being of a few at the expense of the many is showing itself to be unworkable. Conflicts are escalating and environmental systems are breaking down.<br /><br />The time is ripe to build an ALL-WIN world which works well for all, including our environment. The world has become interdependent and this means that it is in the interest of all of us to ensure that all people can achieve meaning and happiness in their lives in their own unique ways providing they harm no one else and that the health of our environment is nurtured. <br /><br />Where discontent reigns we find that individual people can do a great deal of harm. (That is why the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has become traditional international law.) So it is in the interest of us all that each child, woman and man can find their own unique happiness as long as they do not harm others and respect the environment. That is the all-win principle.<br /> <br />Therefore, it is important that all those in government learn to base their own actions and all policies on the all-win norm by constantly asking the questions: Does this action harm anyone? Does this help to strengthen our natural environment? <br /><br />This norm may be hard to understand for many since the inevitability of the win/lose norm has been successfully propagated by those powers that benefited from it.<br /> <br />Therefore it will not be easy for civil servants (and others) to transform their values. It will require ALL TO BE EDUCATED AND GET PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE TO DISTINGUSH BETWEEN WIN/LOSE AND ALL-WIN ACTIONS.<br /><br />They will then realize that there is a huge constituency of people who already support all-win norms. These often belong to non-governmental organizations (there are 1000s of them in the U.S., and 10,000 in a tiny country like Bangladesh alone). All these dedicate their money, energy and time to actions that benefit the greater good. <br /><br />Using all-win policies, the U.S. Administration will gain their support. This will be a mutually reinforcing relationship. They can support all-win actions by the U.S. administration; and with the backing of the U.S. Administration, these groups might form a more cohesive force.<br /><br />Integrating the all-win norm into U.S. politics is essential for the U.S. to regain respect in the world and for President Obama to live up to the great expectations his excellent policies are generating. Integration of the all-win norm in global politics is also essential if our world, inspired among others by the U.S., is to complete the globalization process in a way that strife is transformed into harmony and enmity into goodwill.<br /><br />The all-win norm is visible throughout nature: the cells in the human body function on the basis of all for one and one for all and so do all elements of an ecosystem. We see the all-win principle at work in global society in the form of traffic rules, postal and other communications systems. Through the latest crises, the all-win norm is increasingly catching on. It is realistic and absolutely essential if our world is to work well for all.<br /><br /><br />Perhaps we can get together and see how a number of us can help in this process?<br /><br />Wishing President Obama all the best in the wonderful changes he is making,<br /><br />Dr. Lisinka Ulatowska <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>A shift in consciousness from win/lose to all-win is critical now for the U.S. Administration to govern well at home and play a constructive role in an interdependent world. </div><br />	info	24	29	5	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3480-4049

3482-4049	A "road map" for information for community development	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Community development data as constituted is generally in no order, it is not indexed, and it is very difficult to find and put to use. We need a "one-stop shopping" site on the Web, for community development information. Information is not sorted in the order clients expect to find it. We need a "one-stop shopping" Website for community development. Many of these tasks are already addressed, in some small way, somewhere on the Web. This needs to be centralized, so that people can find info right away, instead of having to know exactly what to look for. This website would include at least:<br />* an "index", listing all major subject areas and keywords. How can one possibly find things without an index?<br />* within each subject area, a "hot link" area to useful websites. As one example, many people interested in economic development have never heard of "Business Incubators", so they would never dream of tracking down www.nbia.org, the National Business Incubator Association. Many people have useful information. Were this puzzle assembled- just of useful info that already is out there, it would be useful to all. <br />* a "community bulletin board" area, sorted by area of the country, state, city, and neighborhood, so that anyone involved in making community projects happen could advertise the project, and solicit donations of money, material and time. There is a site on the web that tries to do this, but how do you find it? This site would have a special section for computers, so that companies could find local nonprofits to transfer excess equipment to. www. volunteermatch.org http://www.helping.org/volunteer/ are good models of what is possible here. freecycle and similar sites would be listed here.<br />* a resource list, which would cite the best books, media resources, and so on, with reviews by site users, perhaps similar to how Amazon.com [cited only as a comparison, no endorsement implied], similar sites, and www.globalideasbank.org does- or perhaps even partner with Amazon and similar sites. This list would be user-driven as much as possible. It doesn't get much easier than a resource list that "writes itself".<br /> * A Best Practices section, sorted by keywords [such as "computer center", "job creation", "microenterprise"], and region, state, city, and neighborhood. <br />There may be other websites doing everything cited in this, but there is no one site putting them all together. <br />* an events calendar, with events sorted by keywords and subject, and region, state, and city. This should be client-driven. I'd recommend web submission, with direct uploading to an Oracle or SQL server database, with immediate posting to the Calendar website When.com used to be a rough model for what I mean [no endorsement implied, cited for comparison only]. <br />There is a good analogy to this. In the early 1920's, roads were for short distance travel, in the minds of most people. There was the "Albany road", for example. However, road maps were published, in that decade. Without adding a single new mile of road, they shifted the paradigm of roads: roads were clearly visible on the map as long roads, and in that decade people started making long trips, because their new paradigm told them they could. Most community development personnel don't have a lot of extra time for finding difficult to locate information, totally aside from not even knowing what to look for. We need a "road map" to the incredible wealth of community resources available. <br />That website needs to have a suggestion area for new ideas, just as with this website I write on. Many community development activities are extremely dependent on volunteers. Students would be more willing to volunteer their time if they could get college credit for their volunteer work- why not have a central place to document this, in collaboration with all colleges. The Renaissance & Enlightenment were not driven by a lot of new ideas, not at first- they were driven because the printing press spread already existing ideas far and wide. <br />A man named Aldus printed every ancient book he could find. We can do the same with this Website- just having "one-stop shopping" alone would cut a lot off the time necessary to plan community programs, and be the equivalent of adding 10-20% more employees, because they have to waste so much time finding basic information. www.indev.org [no endorsement implied] used to do this on a smaller scale for India. We need Community Learning networks, a larger scale of what was done in one library, where any patron could simply fill in a form, declaring that s/he would like to learn, teach or share something (anything). The forms, with appropriate subject headings, were put in the card catalog. When other patrons searched the card catalog, they found not only books and cassettes, but fellow patrons who had something to share. With virtually no promotion, dozens of entries came in, reflecting the impressive (and unpredictable) diversity of the community. Three people offered to teach French--one of whom was simply a transplanted woman from Quebec who wanted to invite people over to lunch so she could speak her native tongue. One was a childhood friend of James Michener, who wanted to talk about his lifelong pal. People wanted to share or exchange vegetarian recipes, dress patterns and local historical anecdotes. Any and every community is a treasure trove of learning resources. What is often missing is a safe, convenient and respectful mechanism to help people to identify and share these resources. A public library is a particularly appropriate venue for this, though other places would work. Libraries are committed to providing a full range of resources to support self-directed learning. One valuable set of resources exist in the patrons themselves. Libraries and their communities would be well served by a "paradigm shift" which viewed each patron as a potential _source_ of information and learning, and not just as a _consumer_ of information and learning. And, if they were committed to this perspective, which is fully consistent with their mission, libraries would be much more useful and relevant to the communities they serve--and members of the community would benefit immensely.

3486-4049	Open Government means Open Goals and Objectives	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Larger cities have Consolidated Plans, for community development, but who reads them? Government agencies have goals. Nonprofits have goals. For profit organizations have community service goals. The President has goals. Congress has goals. Governors and state legislatures have goals. Mayors and city councils have goals. Where is the government "Interstate Highway" Website that puts all these goals together, in one place, for neighborhoods, communities, cities, and larger MSA's? Some years ago, I invited nonprofits providing services for low income personnel in the MSA I work in to a meeting. We sat in a circle. Each person spoke about what they did, what they loved about it, their dreams, and wish lists. People stayed 2 hours after the meeting was supposed to end, excitedly talking, each person there made at least 2 new contacts, who shared their interests. A great deal of good came out of that meeting, for some years. Why can't we do this at a "one-stop shopping" Website, sorted by goal, and objectives within that goal? For example, developing affordable housing- the Habitat folks are well known; they would have their contact information there. Companies are interested in workforce housing, and some allow employees to volunteer with Habitat. There are many other people interested. A model for how this works would be lean manufacturing, and the "virtual" lean workgroup. The goal of providing affordable medical care involves many players; getting them into one area to communicate might be the only way to make this happen. We do have relations with other countries, and the State Department and others have goals regarding foreign countries. So, while you're at it, don't limit the site to American citizens; let foreigners enter their own areas. For example, used books are cheap in the US, but many African universities have very few books. I've seen Africans excitedly buying 20 year old textbooks; when asked why, they tell me anything is better than nothing. Sister city arrangements could go here. A good description of Sarvodaya Shramadana, for example, shows how people can work together to create things no one person or agency could create. The Asset-Based Community Development [no endorsement implied, cited as example only] people surveyed a Chicago neighborhood, acc. to Jody Kretzmann. They found 400 community groups, everything from church choirs, to boy scout troops, to bowling leagues. Due to limited time, they estimated this was less than half the total number of groups. Of the 400, 75% were quite willing to do more in their community, even beyond their stated purpose- and they uniformly said no-one had ever asked them before. <br />The ABCD concept could be one place to start, with this website, and there are preliminary software packages that do this now, though of course they are not widely known. We have more than enough resources to solve all of our problems, the problem is lack of coherence. What we have now is like incoherent light; we need to find a way to focus citizen energy, the way a laser is focused. The goals and objectives are a sort of crystal seed for this, and the focused energy of participants, in this analogy, the excitation of energy similar metaphorically to a laser. <br />Statements, conclusions, surveys, reports, and tools presented should generally be considered to be in draft form, working papers, and do not necessarily reflect the position or views of any agency, organization, department, or Union.

With technologies as they stand today, it is possible to 1) accommodate most customersâ&euro;&trade; needs, 2) streamline the costs of living and waste, and 3) improve education and expedite qualified individuals to the job of their choosing. Imagine being able to determine your own futures and your children have career ambitions before graduating school; the quality of one's life has largely been based on a number of factors like money, transportation, and living accommodations. I find that a strong community can counteract an individual's shortcomings and focus on a growth conducive for all.<br /><br />It does work! Unfortunately, I can not go into too much detail, because it is a secret to my success. I have begun implementing many of these concepts into my business.

The Guantanamo and other similar facilities fly in the face of the entire premise for the founding of the USA. <br /><br />If we cannot convict these people, then they must be freed. Not detained. Freed and deported. Better another building goes down than we abandon our principles. In a war of ideals, the one who abandons his ideals first for the illusion of safety loses.

We're the big guys with the big powers and we have been acting like a bunch of frightened little girls.<br /><br />Furthermore, those responsible for tossing our ideals overboard, authorizing torture, and callously profiteering from the confusion are traitors and must be brought to justice or there will be a next time and we cannot afford a next time.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The USA is a country based on a set of ideals and principles.

3491-4049	The "road map" for community development activity	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Community development information is generally in no order, it is not indexed, and it is very difficult to find and put to use. We need a "one-stop shopping" site on the Web, for community development information. Information is not sorted in the order clients expect to find it. We need a "one-stop shopping" Website for community development. Many of these tasks are already addressed, in some small way, somewhere on the Web. This needs to be centralized, so that people can find info right away, instead of having to know exactly what to look for. This website would include at least:<br />* an "index", listing all major subject areas and keywords. How can one possibly find things without an index?<br />* within each subject area, a "hot link" area to useful websites. As one example, many people interested in economic development have never heard of "Business Incubators", so they would never dream of tracking down www.nbia.org, the National Business Incubator Association. Many people have useful information. Were this puzzle assembled- just of useful info that already is out there, it would be useful to all. <br />* a "community bulletin board" area, sorted by area of the country, state, city, and neighborhood, so that anyone involved in making community projects happen could advertise the project, and solicit donations of money, material and time. There is a site on the web that tries to do this, but how do you find it? This site would have a special section for computers, so that companies could find local nonprofits to transfer excess equipment to. www. volunteermatch.org http://www.helping.org/volunteer/ are good models of what is possible here. freecycle and similar sites would be listed here.<br />* a resource list, which would cite the best books, media resources, and so on, with reviews by site users, perhaps similar to how Amazon.com [cited only as a comparison, no endorsement implied], similar sites, and www.globalideasbank.org does- or perhaps even partner with Amazon and similar sites. This list would be user-driven as much as possible.

We need a "road map" to the incredible wealth of community resources available. <br />That website needs to have a suggestion area for new ideas, just as with this website I write on.

How can we expect to retain valued workers when we are so inflexible regarding work life and family balance?

3501-4049	I would like to see this internet "Brainstorming" technology become a permanent part of US government.	2009-05-27 00:00:00	This internet technology that is currently being hosted by on ideascale.com is used to facilitate brainstorming from anyone with internet access and and idea so that good ideas can be collected and discussed. This brainstorming session ends May 28th. What happens after that? What if someone has a good idea, but missed this brainstorming session deadline. Why not make this technology a permanent part of government to keep it's ears open to the people so that anyone with a good idea can quickly and easily share it ANYTIME. If the idea is truly good, it will rise to the top and gain attention and benefit everyone. I would hate to see this technology be "shelved" and not available after this temporary period.<br /><br />I would like to see the categories be expanded to cover all aspects of US government so that if I had an idea about technology or green energy, for example, there would be a category for that. For example, suppose I wanted to suggest the government look into funding research for determining the feasibility of using lightning (ie from thunderstorms) as a potential green energy source. I've heard there's a lot of energy in a lightning bolt - I've also heard not so much. I would like to be able to share that idea and see what people think. If the idea is truly revolutionary, perhaps the idea would gain attention of top government officials who have decision making power and act on it, put some research dollars into it and maybe benefit the country. How else can a layman submit such ideas? Perhaps there are ways, but would could be easier?<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This is a way anyone with internet access and an idea can share their idea and potentially benefit the country. A good idea stuck in someone's head is no good for society. If we can provide an easy way to tap into more people's ideas, government can collect more ideas to work from and potentially benefit from.</div><br />	wxwise1	60	62	2	6	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3501-4049	
3503-4049	Embracing Collaboration by Creating Active Bodies and Creating Active Zones 	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The best way to change the culture of government to embrace collaboration is:<br /><br />Collaborative behavior is not a stand-alone feature in a culture climate. Collaboration is nested with just a few other activities, including energy-awareness, being healthier and fit. The best way to change the culture of government to embrace collaboration is by implementing a multi-faceted wellness and fitness initiative that already has the weight of law, promoting both fitness and energy-awareness.<br /><br />To achieve this, a low hanging fruit that could be implemented within 30 days is to put power and support behind the "Consider the Stairs Initiative" (Public Law 109-115, Section 607), which states, "The General Services Administration shall conduct a program to promote the use of stairs in all federal buildings." <br /><br />A multi-faceted approach to enhancing the health benefits to federal government employees includes regularly choosing to use the stairwells and hallways (active zones) to get around their workplace. The resulting improved wellness and fitness levels can simultaneously improve the energy-efficiency consciousness as well (see: http://www.activebodyworks.com/opttomove.htm). <br /><br />By developing guidelines related to the physical and aesthetic characteristics of stairwells and hallways (active zones), we can have an initiative to develop collaboration, encourage employees to use the stairwell and hallways (active zones) in an effort to support healthy and active choices, promote overall wellness, and engrain energy-awareness.<br /><br />Active healthy bodies work better, are more efficient, take less sick days and are cheaper in the long run. People who are healthy and active have a greater fitness than inactive members of any culture, and this fitness leads to the tendency to embrace collaboration. Workers who are not healthy and fit generally fail to appreciate the associated direct and indirect benefits of fitness, energy-efficiency and collaboration. <br /><br />Routine use of stairwells and hallways (active zones) will measurably reduce energy costs in all federal buildings by reducing the electricity needed for elevators and escalators. Making these savings known promotes energy consciousness, which is also essential in changing the culture to embrace collaboration. Without energy-awareness and ingrained changes in personal and professional energy consumption, the goals of collaborative behavior stand to fail to become part of the culture.<br /><br />Creating active bodies - creating active zones, with support apposed to words will help transform each member of the culture of the government. Each active body will be empowered to work better within the culture - and ratchet up the culture's efficacy<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>To reduce the governments health care and energy costs as people opt to become healthy, fit and active.</div><br />	tina	-3	2	5	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3503-4049

Fewer cars would mean fewer traffic jams for those that still choose to drive. A dramatic increase in the quality of life for commuters. Fewer cars would reduce oil imports... reduce pollution... increase miles per gallon (traffic jams cause terrible mpg). With ridership increasing, the transit system could increase the quantity of buses and schedule more routes and more times. That would make public transportation practical for more commuters.

"<br />- Patrick O'Heffernan, Blogger, www.socialedge.org<br /><br />"this is so great!!!"<br />- Mark Ritchie, Minnesota Secretary of State<br /><br />TransparentDemocracy is an experiment in developing innovations that increase trust and communication in our institutions so we can optimize our capacity to find win-win solutions to the many challenges we face, as described in the following blog post from HuffingtonPost (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kim-cranston/humanitys-greatest-challe_b_196128.html):<br /><br />Humanity's Greatest Challenge and Its Solution<br /><br />Climate change is not humanity's greatest challenge (even though scientists predict it may unleash public unrest, cross-border conflicts and mass migration in 20 years, and increase the global surface temperature up to 11.5 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100).<br /><br />Neither are pandemics, nuclear proliferation, water scarcity, the Middle East conflict, or many other things you might think. <br /><br />Our greatest challenge is that our institutions can't resolve any of these challenges, let alone prioritize climate change as the challenge that poses the greatest threat if we don't act immediately. Until we address the crisis of the failure of our institutions to resolve the significant challenges we face, don't expect progress on any of them.<br /><br />Climatologists are beginning to recognize that institutional failure is our real problem:<br /><br />"One of the problems is that the issue is still being framed as a scientific and environmental issue. This is a major mistake. Climate change is just a symptom of dysfunctional social and economic practices and policies. It is a social and economic issue. The emphasis needs to shift away from the biophysical sciences now to the social sciences if we have any hope of solving this problem," said Bob Doppelt, director of the climate leadership initiative at the University of Oregon.<br /><br />Stephen Schneider, a climatologist at Stanford University, said: "Can democracy survive complexity? That is what this [energy-environment] problem represents. It is so difficult. It is multi-scale, multidisciplinary, with large certainty in some areas and small certainty in others. It is irreversible and reversible and we won't know how we did until it is over. We will only know forty years later. That is why climate complexity is a challenge to democracy. Democracy is short term."<br /><br />The institutions we rely on to address the major challenges we face have many shortcomings. They don't view the challenges in a holistic manner or appreciate their interrelationships and those of their solutions (fortunately, we now have a U.S. President who seems to have a holistic view of our challenges; unfortunately, he's leading an institution that doesn't). They seem unable to anticipate, let alone address, challenges whose consequences won't manifest within the financial quarter of economic institutions or the two, four, or six-year terms of officeholders in government institutions. They are easily manipulated by special interests, money, criminals, nuts, and whoever speaks the loudest or has the ear of a decision maker last. They lack transparency that fosters understanding, involvement, and faith in how and why decisions are made. And the "solutions" they implement too often compound the problems they're supposed to resolve - like the hydra myth, each purported solution creates multiple new problems. <br /><br />In order to address climate change (and give it the priority it demands), as well as the other significant challenges we face, we must rapidly evolve the capacity of our institutions to make better decisions than the ones that have put our survival in jeopardy.<br /><br />In his book Nonzero: The Logic Of Human Destiny, Robert Wright posits that the best way to understand the evolution of human institutions is from the perspective of non-zero-sum game playing, which allows for win-win outcomes. Wright argues that non-zero-sum game playing is optimized by communication and trust, and that whenever communication and trust are lacking, new technologies emerge that increase their presence.<br /><br />In a period seemingly devoid of trust and communication in governmental and economic institutions, the Web (the kind of technology Robert Wright wrote of) has unleashed a blizzard of information. Other innovations are beginning to help us organize the Web's massive flow of information in ways to make it trustworthy and actionable through an expanding number of communications technologies. There are many valuable experiments underway to leverage the Web to increase transparency in our institutions, including (but certainly not limited to) efforts funded by the Sunlight Foundation, such as Change-Congress.org and MapLight.org, and to use the Web for social change, including efforts covered by techPresident and the Personal Democracy Forum. At TransparentDemocracy, we're experimenting with ways to let people see how organizations and people they trust recommend they make governmental, economic, and other decisions. And there are many technologies, such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia, and Twitter, which have the potential to significantly increase the ability of people to make a difference by making our institutions more accountable and responsive. <br /><br />However, the resources available to support experiments to leverage the Web and other technologies for these purposes are woefully inadequate for the task at hand. An article by Jon Gertner in The New York Times Magazine on April 19, 2009 reported that "about 98 percent of the federal financing for climate-change research goes to the physical and natural sciences, with the remainder apportioned to the social sciences," a fraction of which goes to understanding how we make decisions about addressing climate change. Hopefully, the allocation of resources will soon respond to the admonition of climatologists that this is not "a scientific and environmental issue" but rather "a social and economic issue." Just as resources are needed to develop new energy sources and other solutions to climate change, resources are needed to evolve our institutional capacity so we can make wise decisions about which of those new energy sources and solutions we should pursue. And so we can make wise decisions about options we'll be forced to choose among to adapt to and mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, including geoengineering (using potentially radical technologies to cool the Earth's air), which the nation's top scientist, John Holdren, has said has "got to be looked at. We don't have the luxury of taking any approach off the table."<br /><br />In addition to investing in new tools to effectively organize to address the many challenges we face, we need to invest in developing people - organizers - who can effectively use the new tools. "Tools don't build houses. Carpenters build houses," explains Marshall Ganz, who has been credited as the architect of Obama's field campaign (a fantastic fusion of effective organizers and new technologies). <br /><br />Perhaps the most underreported, significant outcome (and legacy) of the Obama campaign is the army of organizers it trained. Just like the civil rights, farm worker, anti-Vietnam War, and other historic movements, the Obama campaign produced a large number of skilled organizers who will continue to contribute to American society for years to come in other organizing efforts. We urgently need to engage these organizers in addressing the looming threat of climate change and the other significant challenges we face.<br /><br />H.G. Wells said "History is a race between education and catastrophe." Current events suggest that education may be losing that race. It is already too late for us to avoid all of the consequences of climate change - the earth's global surface temperature and the seas are rising at accelerating rates. <br /><br />Our best hope is to invest in accelerating the development and deployment of innovations that increase trust and communication in our institutions so we can optimize our capacity to find win-win solutions to climate change and the other challenges we face. <br /><br />Dee Hock, the Founder and CEO Emeritus of Visa Inc, recognized some time ago that most of the "problems" we think we have "are symptom not disease. At bottom, we have an institutional problem, and until we properly diagnose and deal with it, all societal problems will get progressively worse."<br /><br />Continuing to expect our institutions to resolve the "problems" that their "solutions" are in fact compounding may fit Albert Einstein's definition of insanity: "doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results." As Einstein observed: "The significant problems we face cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them." It is time for us to consciously evolve our institutions to a higher level from which they can solve the problems they are now creating - the survival of our civilizations, and perhaps our species, depends on it.<br /><br />See also:<br /><br />Train skilled community organizers to strengthen our democracy:<br />http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3499-4049<br /><br />Government use of social media should focus more on "small groups of smart people arguing with each other" - Clay Shirky<br />http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3528-4049<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Our greatest challenge is not climate change, pandemics, nuclear proliferation, water scarcity, the Middle East conflict, or many other things you might think.

3506-4049	Provide Public Access/Re-use of Central Contractor Registry (CCR.gov)	2009-05-27 00:00:00	As a database developer and open government advocate, few things are as frustrating to the development of robust data sets and accountability tools as the lack of access to reliable, unique identifiers for government contractors.<br /><br />To solve this problem, the Central Contractor Registration Database should be made immediately available to the public, including DUNS numbers and DUNS corporate ownership relationship. Having a taxpayer supported database of corporate contractors unavailable to the public and using proprietary vendor IT system is untenable in 2009. <br /><br />A DUNS Number is a corporate identifier assigned by the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. It is like a corporate social security number and is the private and public sector to make it easier to track credit worthiness. While any business can get a DUNS Number for free, it costs money to gain access to Dun & Bradstreet database of DUNS Number. (This database also contains information regarding the relationship among DUNS Numbers, e.g. corporate ownership of subsidiaries, facilities, etc.) D&B; claims this database as the companies own intellectual property.<br /><br />The problem is not that D&B; claims this database as their property. The problem is that D&B; has government-sponsored monopoly on the IDs the government uses for tracking corporate government vendors...and the public cannot gain access to this piece of the D&B; DUNS Number database even though we pay for it.<br /><br />Since 2003, the federal Office of Budget and Management has required all government contractors to have a "DUNS Number" assigned via Central Contractor Registration (CCR.gov). I'm fairly certain this contract (http://bit.ly/12zeSU) relates to an expansion of the CCR/DUNS work. <br /><br />Because the public does not have unfettered access to this database of unique identifiers is not possible for third parties, particularly non-profits, academics, and citizens to leverage this identifier in their own workings with data. A government data set might include a corporations DUNS Number, but without the corporate relationship information, the relationships among corporations and basic disambiguation of entities must be manually re-done time and time again. <br /><br />Making the DUNS Number for corporate contractors available to all, or better, available in a RESTFUL manner on CCR.gov (example: ccr.gov/id/xxxxxxx) would provide the same functionality that Amazon URLs do for books and IMDB.com does for movies. <br /><br />Alternatively, the US government should stop using proprietary identifiers and simply leverage Web URLs from CCR.gov to provide the same information. A vendor such as Dun & Bradstreet could be employed to manage the system, but the system itself for tracking government contractors with unique identifiers should be public and non proprietary.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea is important because database work is significantly easier when all parties have access to the same unique identifiers. This is recognized by the Federal Government enterprise in that it requires central registration of contractors. The broad publication and use of these vendor IDs would allow the public to more affordable participation in monitoring the activity of vendors and would create incentives for vendors to behave honestly. If every contract and every sanction included the vendors public identifier, vendors would be more careful.<br /><br />The availability of this information would also lead to significant cost savings at government agencies and in the private and non-profit sectors. Right now agencies and government officials must request access to the data. That means each party gaining access is likely to be creating their own systems to maintain that data. That is unnecessary redundancy and hinders innovation that would otherwise happen if everyone was freely working off the same reference.<br /><br />Lastly, this is important because government should not be using taxpayer dollars to create/maintain a private monopoly on information, especially when other parties could compete to provide the service. D&B;'s arrangement with the government provides them with an unfair competitive position in the commercial marketplace while simultaneously locking the government into future contracts with D&B.;<br /><br />Greg Elin<br />http://twitter.com/gregelin</div><br />	Greg Elin	32	34	2	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3506-4049

3512-4049	Transparency, availability, and understandability of chemicals and radioactive materials released to the environment by governme	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Currently there is no requirement for government and industrial facilities to make data available about the types and amounts of materials they release to the environment. When these materials cross facility boundaries and the potential exists for public exposure, this information should be available to the public on a timely basis. But providing only data is not enough. Facilities should help the public understand what the data mean in terms of human health risk and whether concentrations being measured exceed standards. This issue was recently highlighted with the recognition that there are schools around the country, where children are unknowingly being exposed to levels of potentially harmful materials release by nearby facilities. <br /><br />A model for this process now exists at www.racernm.com for the Los Alamos National Laboratory. RACER is Risk Analysis, Communication, and Reduction. The web site is managed by an independent entity, the New Mexico Community Foundation to enhance credibility and trust. The site contains over 6 million records and through the web, allows the public to see where contamination exists and how measurements in the environment compare to regulations or other standards.<br /><br />RACER has been of immense importance in opening up a government facility with a history of secrecy because of its mission. It is significantly changing the public's perception and understanding of Los Alamos National Laboratory. RACER has also helped the New Mexico Environment Department, regulator of Los Alamos, do its job more efficiently and effectively.<br /><br />This concept of transparency, availability and understandability should be the standard applied to any facility releasing chemicals or radioactive materials to the environment that may pose a risk to the public or the environment.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The concept of transparency, availability and understandability implemented by RACER should be the standard applied to any facility releasing chemicals or radioactive materials to the environment that may pose a <br /><br />risk to the public or the environment.

There should be no special entitlements given to anyone except for children, the disabled and the eldely. Entitlements should apply to everyone. There should be no special allowance for married persons unless they have children or fit into the above special categories. All "marriages" are civll contracts and therefore have societal legal inplications. We should maintain the separation of Church and State by having all such contracts performed in a civil court --like France. Religious ceromonies are separate and private and should have no bearing on the legal status. If any special entitlements are to be conferred on married couples then it has to be extended to all people otherwise it is favoring certain groups in society over others.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>We are becoming a nation of special interest groups.

3523-4049	Break down the barriers to Open Government positively, collaboratively, and proactively	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Open government requires transformation - it must happen. However, the nature of government is to resist transformation. Therefore, the irresistible force of transformation WILL meet the immovable object of bureaucracy and resistance. If this collision is not anticipated and proactively addressed, the benefits of Open Government will be delayed, taxpayer money will be wasted, and high-profile failures will be used against the proponents of Open Government further slowing down what is in all of our best interests.<br /><br />Recognizing that this collision will happen, the public sector must work with its private sector partners to implement a combination of policy, funding, communication and management initiatives which provide a platform, protection and toolkit for those agencies and programs which want to implement Open Government.<br /><br />First, policy must be addressed. The White House and Congress have made a good first step with the implementation of Recovery.gov. This is an excellent example of "carrot and stick" approach, where if an Agency receives funding, it must comply with a new standard of transparency and reporting. This same model should be evaluated closely for Open Government. For new initiatives such as Data.gov, the leadership in government must find a way to enforce Open Government as well as encourage it, going beyond voluntary participation by the agencies.<br /><br />Next, creative funding should be addressed. Given that the CIOs see Open Government as the next in a long series of unfunded mandates, how can pressures be eased in practical and efficient manner? One approach will be to "seed" small initiatives in each Agency. The White House, working with Congress can play the role of venture capitalist, with each Agency representing areas of possible investment. Ask each CIO to a few candidates for small, agile and quick transformation; have them present to an investment board which evaluates on the principals of ROI, and quickly release funds.<br /><br />And, communication should be addressed. Many CIO and Agency heads want to implement Open Government, but how? What are the best practices? Where are the centers of excellence, contract vehicles, template management plans and lessons learned which can reduce risk and increase confidence? The White House's newly appointed CIO and CTO should spearhead a special session of the agency CIO council to specifically address these issues. Through participation, the Agency CIOs and their staff will gain valuable information on how to launch Open Government initiatives. Further, the building blocks of Web 2.0 and open source can greatly assist in this area with inter-agency collaboration.<br /><br />Finally, management must be addressed. If an Open Government initiative is launched at an Agency, and transformation is the goal, does that imply that a new way of program and project management must also be implemented? Partially, yes. Open Government does require a new way of thinking, but many traditional management approaches work just fine. Government needs to merge their existing standards and management models, evaluate emerging private sector approaches (ex: agile project management, cloud computing), and come up with a hybrid approach that works for them. A key for any transformational initiative will be to test the new approach on a small scale first, obtain success, build enthusiasm, and then scale out. This also compliments the funding constraints mentioned above.<br /><br />In summary, for those of us that believe in the promise of Open Government, we must provide the environment for the first wave of initiatives to succeed. This environment is a collection, or toolkit, which the Agencies use to get evolutionary projects off the ground, proving success, and gaining enthusiasm. We need to nurture those that take the initial risk. And, we need to provide the platform for when those projects DO succeed, the second and much bigger wave occurs, truly embedding the principles of Open Government into core Agency strategy and implementation.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The proactive application of policy, funding, communication and management strategies will greatly speed the adoption of Open Government transformation within government.</div><br />	Jason Nichols	12	12	0	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3523-4049	
3524-4049	Journalists call for ending agencies' tracking and monitoring of interviews	2009-05-27 00:00:00	<br /><br />The Society of Professional Journalists and the Association of Health Care Journalists have called on the administration to end the prohibitions many federal agencies have against any employee speaking to journalists unless the conversations are tracked and monitored by the public relations office.<br />This practice, which has grown up and become more and more restrictive over about the last 15 years, is censorship and reduces severely what the public is allowed to know about the agencies' processes.<br /><br />Staff members are frequently far more informative when they are not being tracked or monitored. Sometimes they point reporters to reliable information that is not mentioned in official releases or that would indicate why official statements are misleading. Sometimes they point out waste or abuse of power. Often neither Congress nor the public would understand critical points if it were not for these communications.<br /> <br />On the other hand, with monitoring in place, officials dictate an official story and staff members rarely deviate from it.<br /><br />In addition, many interviews are simply never allowed. The application process to speak is often lengthy, discouraging journalists from trying. Public affairs officers often don't get back to the reporter or they simply deny permission to speak. <br /><br />Whistleblower protections are absolutely essential and should be made much stronger. However, for most matters, if we wait for whistleblowers to speak up publically, thus alienating the people they work for, we will remain in ignorant bliss, perhaps forever. We need journalists and federal staff members talking on a normal, fluid basis, confidentially if necessary.<br /><br />In 1972, a 40-year experiment that withheld syphilis treatment from 399 African American men was ended only after a federal staff member educated an Associated Press reporter about that program. Today that kind of "unofficialized" contact between reporter and staff is outlawed.<br />This censorship will induce malfeasance at some point, probably many points. We need to call a halt to it.<br /><br />Kathryn Foxhall<br />Freelance reporter<br /><br />Below are excerpts from the associations' letters:<br /><br /><br />From the Association of Healthcare Journalists:<br /><br />Mr. President,<br />In the spirit of government transparency, the Association of Health<br />Care Journalists respectfully calls on you to end policies that require<br />public affairs officers to approve and monitor journalists' interviews<br />with federal staff.<br /><br />Such policies, which are in place at such critical agencies as the<br />Centers for Disease Control, the Food and Drug Administration, the<br />National Institutes of Health, and most agencies of the Department of<br />Health and Human Services, hamper newsgathering and interfere with<br />the public's right to know.<br /><br />These policies make it difficult for reporters to fulfill their obligation<br />to hold government accountable to the citizens it serves. In practice,<br />they limit the number of contacts reporters can make and increase the<br />probability of erroneous or incomplete information being passed to<br />the public. Further, they deny the public access to the vast reservoir of<br />experts who are paid by their tax dollars.<br /><br />Public information officers can play a key role in facilitating and<br />coordinating communication, but often they are used to inhibit the<br />flow of information to the public rather than foster it. It is common for<br />reporters to wait days for permission to conduct an interview.<br />Sometimes a request is simply ignored or denied entirely. Such red<br />tape is particularly onerous in the online era, when stories are reported<br />and published in a matter minutes or hours.<br /><br />The monitoring of interviews poses another blockade that chills<br />communication by signaling to staff members that their words must<br />comply with an "official story."<br /><br />Restrictions on journalists' access to federal sources have grown<br />during the last two presidential administrations. This trend should be<br />reversed. We urge you to take the following steps to restore the free<br />flow of information:<br /><br />• Instruct federal agencies to review their policies to ensure they foster<br />rather than impede newsgathering.<br /><br />• Restore direct access to sources and prohibit requirements that<br />journalists and federal staff members notify or obtain permission from<br />a public affairs officer or other official to conduct an interview.<br /><br />• Prohibit requirements that dictate the monitoring of interviews by public affairs staff.<br /><br />The federal government sets the standard for state and local governments, private organizations, businesses, and other nations. To maintain our democracy and restore confidence in public institutions, it is imperative that federal agencies operate in the sunshine.<br /><br /><br />From the Society of Professional Journalists:<br /><br />The Society of Professional Journalists strongly urges President Obama to put an end to the practice of federal public affairs officers monitoring calls between reporters and federal employees.<br /><br />For years, the federal government has become increasingly controlling of what government employees say to the press, to the point of muzzling the flow of information that the public needs. We object to the inherited practice of requiring journalists to get approval from public relations officers to interview government employees. When such requests are denied the public is poorly served. Usually the most accurate information comes from the federal employees closest to the facts, not a go-between person potentially intent on spinning the information for political purposes. This practice is a disservice to Americans.<br /><br />Public information officers play an important role in providing information and facilitating interviews, but previous administrations have used these positions to increase secrecy, not understanding. We are hopeful the president will stick to his promise of making government more transparent and more accountable by ending this disturbing method of information control.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The public can easily be misled with an official story if journalists can't have fluid contact with staff members, on a confidential basis, if necessary.</div><br />	kfoxhall	16	18	2	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3524-4049	
3526-4049	Plain Language in Goverment Documents	2009-05-27 00:00:00	I support the Plain Writing Act of 2009 currently in the Senate and the Plain Language Act of 2009 currently in the House. Both bills would require that all government documents that convey information about benefits and services be written in plain language. We should extend that bill to include regulatory information as well. Small business (and corporations) often have a difficult time complying with regulations because the language is so complex and convoluted. The more this administration can use plain language to communicate with the public in ANY situation, but better informed we are and the better citizens we become. Even complex, legal information can be written so that non-experts can understand it. It's time to pass the bills and continue to push for plain language in plain sight (as in the new credit card bill) in federal documents. Whenever possible, transparency and plain language should be the default setting for government communication.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>An informed citizenry is the cornerstone of democracy. We cannot be informed if we don't understand the information that the government provides. We cannot make informed choices or decisions on matters that affect our lives and our nation if we can't understand it. We cannot take advantage of government benefits and services if we don't understand the information. Confusion and chaos are counterproductive to an effective citizenry.</div><br />	deborah	26	30	4	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3526-4049

3534-4049	Abolish Private "for profit" Prisons in America	2009-05-27 00:00:00	<br /><br />A "SINGLE VOICE PROJECT" is the official name of the petition sponsored by: The National Public Service Council To Abolish Private Prisons (NPSCTAPP)<br /><br />THIS PETITION SEEKS TO ABOLISH ALL PRIVATE PRISONS IN THE UNITED STATES, (or any place subject to its jurisdiction)<br /><br /><br />The National Public Service Council To Abolish Private Prisons (NPSCTAPP) is a grass roots organization driven by a single objective. We want the United States government to reclaim sole authority for state and federal prisons on US soil. <br />We want the United States Congress to immediately rescind all state and federal contracts that permit private prisons "for profit" to exist in the United States, or any place subject to its jurisdiction. We understand that the problems that currently plague our government, its criminal justice system and in particular, the state & federal bureau of prisons (and most correctional and rehabilitation facilities) are massive. However, it is our solemn belief that the solutions for prison reform will remain unattainable and virtually impossible as long as private prisons for profit are permitted to operate in America. <br /><br />Prior to the past month, and the fiasco of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AIG, Lehman Brothers, and now the "Big Three" American Automobile manufacturers, the NPSCTAPP has always felt compelled to highlight the "moral Bottom line" when it comes to corrections and privatization. Although, we remain confounded by the reality that our government has allowed our justice system to be operated by private interests. The NPSCTAPP philosophy has always been "justice" should not be for sale at any price. It is our belief that the inherent and most fundamental responsibility of the criminal justice system should not be shirked, or "jobbed-out." This is not the same as privatizing the post office or some trash pick up service in the community. There has to be a loss of meaning and purpose when an inmate looks at a guard's uniform and instead of seeing an emblem that reads State Department of Corrections or Federal Bureau of Prisons, he sees one that says: "Atlas Prison Corporation."<br /><br /> Let's assume that the real danger of privatization is not some innate inhumanity on the part of its practitioners but rather the added financial incentives that reward inhumanity. The same logic that motivates companies to operate prisons more efficiently also encourages them to cut corners at the expense of workers, prisoners and the public. Every penny they do not spend on food, medical care or training for guards is a dime they can pocket. What happens when the pennies pocketed are not enough for the shareholders? Who will bailout the private prison industry when they hold the government and the American people hostage with the threat of financial failure…"bankruptcy?" What was unimaginable a month ago merits serious consideration today. State and Federal prison programs originate from government design, and therefore, need to be maintained by the government. It's time to restore the principles and the vacated promise of our judicial system. <br /><br /><br /><br />John F. Kennedy said, "The time to repair the roof is while the sun is shinning". Well the sun may not be shinning but, it's not a bad time to begin repair on a dangerous roof that is certain to fall…. because, "Incarcerating people for profit is, in a word WRONG" <br /><br />There is an urgent need for the good people of this country to emerge from the shadows of cynicism, indifference, apathy and those other dark places that we migrate to when we are overwhelmed by frustration and the loss of hope. <br />It is our hope that you will support the NPSCTAPP with a show of solidarity by signing our petition. We intend to assemble a collection of one million signatures, which will subsequently be attached to a proposition for consideration. This proposition will be presented to both, the Speaker Of The House Of Representatives (Nancy Pelosi) and the United States Congress.<br />The SINGLE VOICE PETITION and the effort to abolish private "for profit" prisons is the sole intent of NPSCTAPP. Our project does not contain any additional agendas. We have no solutions or suggestions regarding prison reform. However, we are unyielding in our belief that the answers to the many problems which currently plague this nation's criminal justice system and its penal system in particular, cannot and will not be found within or assisted by the private "for profit" prison business. The private "for profit" prison business has a stranglehold on our criminal justice system. Its vice-like grip continues to choke the possibility of justice, fairness, and responsibility from both state and federal systems. <br />These new slave plantations are not the answer! <br /><br />For more information please visit: http://www.npsctapp.blogspot.com <br />To sign the petition please visit: http://www.petitiononline.com/gufree2/petition.html <br /><br />THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>These new slave plantations are not the answer! </div><br />	williamthomas	38	41	3	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3534-4049

3543-4049	Automatic Saving and Storage of E-mails and other Electronic Records in their Original Format	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The federal government can become more environmentally friendly and more efficient by taking the relatively undemanding step of creating a system which automatically saves, catalogues and organizes all electronically created records in electronic format.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It is our understanding that even short, simple E-mail between two government employees that constitutes a record for purpose of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") will be printed out and physically placed in a file. This creates needless paper that, aside from its negative effect on our natural resources, requires extra effort to locate and reproduce. Time spent in the physical search of paper files for a one page E-mail is time that could be spent processing other requests. It doesn't have to be that way.<br /><br /><br /><br />There are technology products available that will automatically save every electronic document created on a given computer or network. Each newly created document can be saved according to several criteria which will make the document easier to find by those processing the request. The federal government could purchase such a product or use existing products as a model to build its own system.<br /><br /><br /><br />This approach would not only be "green" and efficient, but also consistent with existing law. The Electronic Freedom of Information Act amendments of 1996 ("EFOIA") changed FOIA to require:<br /><br />"In making any record available to a person under this paragraph, an agency shall provide the record in any form or format requested by the person if the record is readily reproducible by the agency in that form or format. Each agency shall make reasonable efforts to maintain its records in forms or formats that are reproducible for purposes of this section.<br /><br /><br />"In responding under this paragraph to a request for records, an agency shall make reasonable efforts to search for the records in electronic form or format, except when such efforts would significantly interfere with the operation of the agency's automated information system." (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3)(A)-(B).)<br /><br />It is becoming increasingly rare that records are originally created in paper format. Creating a system that instantly saves electronic records and facilitates the search for those records does not hinder the ability of a requester to receive his or her request a preferred format. We assume that even electronic records which have been printed out for filing and storage continue to exist in electronic format. The only change through this system is that paper is not created unless and until a requester asks for a paper copy.<br /><br /><br /><br />We understand that there will be a cost involved in creating and implementing this type of system but believe that this upfront cost, plus any later maintenance, greatly outweighs the time and resources spent in needlessly creating paper records that are, at best, useless, and at worst another hindrance to an already overburdened processing system. Given the cost, we are not advocating that this system be applied retroactively, but only for those records created after the effective date of the system.<br /><br /></div><br />	Sunshine in Government Initiative	20	20	0	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3543-4049	
3544-4049	Don’t Track Users on Government Web Sites	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Very few Internet users really understand how persistent identifiers, such as "cookies," record and track their online activities. But it is clear that when users take the time to examine this issue, they are not happy. This was clear when the White House initially proposed to make the President's speeches available on YouTube without taking privacy into account. Changes were made, but the problem could have been avoided.<br /><br />EPIC strongly favors public access to new media and the government's innovative use of new technology. At the same time, we think it is unnecessary and shortsighted to allow government agencies to stalk citizens with persistent identifiers.<br /><br />EPIC recommends that the administration extend the policy against persistent identifiers to all government web sites. The government should not be tracking the public's access to government information.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>President Obama established as a priority the collaboration between executive departments and agencies and the public. Tracking individuals who access government information would contradict these goals. The government should ensure the privacy of all citizens.<br /><br /></div><br />	Electronic Privacy Information Center	80	87	7	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3544-4049	
3546-4049	Government version of an Institutional Repository using Knowledge Management techniques	2009-05-27 00:00:00	I have often heard, when someone is referring to the US government, that the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. We are still even now, emerging from the Cold War era thinking that keeping secrets, even amongst those individuals who are thought to be on the same side, is the best way to operate. This type of thinking should no longer be enabled.<br /><br /> Our world has grown larger due to the advancements in communication technology and online resources, we can no longer afford to have our government agencies stand in the dark while the rest of the globe passes them by. I would recommend the adoption of a type of institutional repository of government knowledge - a place where information of all types from various agency points could be stored and accessed internally by those who needed it. This would not only include the standard explicit knowledge pieces of documents, reports, memos, etc., but also a catalog of the individuals who work within our government and the tacit knowledge (the experience and topical intelligence) that each person can bring.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>With this pool of intel, if you will, I believe that more collaboration on projects/cases/issues would begin to take place. If one was able to access the pertinent information or speak with the most informed person, to me it would seem only beneficial in the pursuit of open dialogue within our government. And hopefully it would begin to break down the walls we've erected between agency interaction.</div><br />	regs22	1	3	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3546-4049	
3547-4049	In rulemaking & other comment periods, involve the public early; encourage interaction	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Public comments in the final stages of rulemaking (the process agencies use to translate legislation into action) are not the most participatory technique, but - online - they are far more transparent than in the past, and generally mandatory! However, by the time a proposed rule or other action is open for comments, important decisions may already have been made. Involving the public earlier and increasing interaction will move toward a more participatory process, can build understanding, and may produce better decisions. Examples:<br />- Encourage agencies to use Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRMs) to request comments at an earlier, more flexible stage and to encourage interactions among those with different views. Direct agencies to post ANPRM dockets (comments, background and so forth) on regulations.gov, and to use the same identifying number for the later Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).<br />- Assure that all agencies know that a second round of comments is possible and use this when appropriate. This allows commenters to say what they think of otherâ&euro;&trade;s first-round comments, even if the comments came in late.<br />- Experiment with real discussions (not voting) alongside comment periods, wikis, and other ways to increase understanding and interaction. <br />- Build capacity by providing specific guidelines and training for agency personnel, plus background information for the public.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	rgunn	28	28	0	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3547-4049

3549-4049	Suggestion Box; Protect Greenland Ice Cover	2009-05-27 00:00:00	I would like to see a Suggestion Box for new ideas beyond the brainstorming period. I have a brainstorming idea: protect the Greenland ice cover. Per the Discovery Channel "Project Earth" DVD's, this can be done by installing reflective cover sheets over portions of the coastal areas. This would be very costly and may require United Nations funding but if the ice cover melts the consequences would be a rise of at least 2 feet in global sea elevations, putting huge numbers of people and property at risk, a far more costly consequence. Recovery of meltwaters shipped by tankers to fill aquifers would partially offset the capital costs. This is a high priority issue and deserves appropriate attention. Thank you. Terry Fisher, P.Eng.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Prevent inundation of coastal areas of highly-populated areas with seawater due to rising sea levels, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES.

3551-4049	Strategy Markup Language & 501(c)(3) Nonprofits	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Use AIIM's emerging Srategy Markup Language (StratML) to enable potential peformance partners to more easily discover and identify each other based upon common missions, visions, values, goals, objectives, and stakeholders. It would be especially appropriate to enable nonprofit, public service organizations performing quasi-governmental functions to post their strategic plans on their own Web sites in StratML format and thereby be absolved of having to supply the same data redundantly to IRS to qualify for 501(c)(3) status. Use of StratML would also enable .gov agencies to comply with paragraph 202(b)(4) of the eGov Act, which requires agencies to "... link their performance goals ... to key groups, including citizens, businesses, and other governments ..."<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>There is much talk of the importance of strategic "alignment" but actual practice leaves much to be desired. Aside from the Constitution, laws, and regulations, perhaps nothing is as important and relevant to government service than helping citizens (and potential partners in the private sector) to understand what agencies are trying to DO (i.e., their strategic goals and objectives) -- without requiring them to know anything other than what they themeselves (the citizens) need or want to do. Use of the StratML standard will enable realization of such a vision.</div><br />	owen	1	3	2	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3551-4049

3554-4049	National Electronic Voting Kiosk Network	2009-05-27 00:00:00	We should create a network of electronic voting kiosks (EVK), similar to ATMs that are everywhere across the world. However, these EVKs must be owned and maintained by the government, without any influence by private business. The ownership of the vote must be by the people, hence, only our government should be able to administer and maintain our voting system, electronic or paper based.<br /><br />The most important aspect of the software that runs on these EVKs is that is must be open source (that is the source code can be read and reviewed by anyone. This is so that 'we the people' can review the code that is doing the work powering our democracy) and the software compilation and installment process must be openly reviewable by both Congress and private citizens. The open source caveat must also apply to the operating system of the EVKs, there must be no private business proprietary software in the units. This could be end point verifiable by private citizens being able to use freely downloadable software and a common interface for obtaining information (only! there should be no mechanism for private citizens to upload data to the kiosk, the only data the kiosk should record is voting data via the display) about the software running on the kiosks. The downloadable verification software could then independantly report a verification message to the government with the kiosk id, citizen id and authentication tokens and verification results. Actions could be taken upon the kiosk upon the results of these verifications such as shutting down the unit until government technicitians are able to service the unit, subjecting any votes cast by the unit to manual scrutiny, prompting further citizens attempting to use the unit to perform additional verifications and submit results until the unit is serviced or it is determined that someone submitted a false report (at which point the false report could be investigated as election tampering).<br /><br />This would provide a high level of faith in the system, in that anyone could run end point verifications. Also anyone could review the source code of these systems and the government records of EVK servicing.<br /><br />The reason for using a kiosk network instead of making access available to home computers is twofold: first it allows access to anyone, second it provides a high level of voter security.<br /><br />In terms of access to anyone, it is important that participation in our democracy not be restricted to those affluent / technologically savvy enough to be able to afford / use a computer. An ATM-like kiosk should be simple enough to use that anyone should be able to participate. For those citizens living abroad, we should be able to set up these EVKs in our consulates in foreign countries at the very least. I am certain that there are other places that could be identified to make these places available to citizens abroad. Obviously we should not take United Nations assistance for granted, but it seems likely we would be able to work something out with the UN to expand our democratic participation.<br /><br />It will be a matter of utmost importance to verify the identity of people logging in to system to record their votes. It is likewise of utmost importance to prevent electronic tampering with the system. The EVKs, being kiosks with very limited input capability and with almost no contact to the internet at large would be very secure and not subject to the vagaries of viruses, worms, keystroke-loggers and such that plague the common home computer. This would provide a high level of reassurance to the public that their voting system is not being tampered with.<br /><br />The EVKs would be located in post offices, public libraries and possibly government buildings as well.<br /><br />Obviously, tampering with this system would need to be made a federal crime with stiff penalties.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This would leverage the benefits of electronic voting: speed, accuracy, ease of use, while minimizing the downsides of electronic voting: public confidence in system accuracy / reliability, voting security over the internet, accessibility to those without computers.</div><br />	David Langer	-3	4	7	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3554-4049	
3555-4049	Redefine and revitalize role of libraries - convene non-partisan citizen dialogue events	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Simply put, there are very few truly non-partisan environments that have a presence in every community across our nation. Libraries, a friend argued recently, are the "last bastion od democracy" - and are uniquely positioned to gather their local citizens into a new national democratic practice of getting together regularly to: access and share information; voice opinions, and take action as individuals or in groups.<br /><br />Libraries can truly create and facilitate a "National Dialogue."<br /><br />The ideal "National dialogue event" would be a seamless on and offline process and include multiple stakeholders on every issue, be presented in a similar format, for every issue - creating a "method to the madness" for citizens, allowing them to feel as if consuming an issue is the same practice and process no matter the issue, leaving them able to focus more time and attention on the details of the issue.<br /><br />I am looking for people to work with on creating a series of "Actionshops" - a non-partisan workshop model that I have been piloting.

Transparency in government is only possible if we have a common understanding of a proposal or issue. Common understanding is best promoted through the use of plain English. Access to the government will increase as greater numbers of people understand what the government is saying. This will be the case, not just for people with less education, but for well-educated people unfamiliar with bureaucratic jargon. And participation in government will increase when more people understand the issues being proposed or discussed. Finally, the government's consideration of issues will become more efficient because the use of plain English will eliminate many of the conflicts and misunderstandings that arise out of poorly drafted documents. </div><br />	pxc	22	26	4	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3556-4049	
3557-4049	U.S.A. Community Trust Fund Initiative (the “CTF Initiative”)	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Action Steps to implement all three Phases of the Community Trust Fund Initiative:<br />Action Step 1: Consolidate all available economic recovery and bailout funding authority under one agency. Place all of these resources under the U.S.A. Community Trust Fund Initiative (the "CTF Initiative"). It is recommended that the CTF Initiative be established under auspices of the Secretary for the U.S. Department of Commerce (the "Department of Commerce"). Even though the Troubled Asset Relief<br />Implementation Strategy - 8<br />Program ("TARP") is under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Independent Scholars Group believes that the Department of Commerce has the mission, overall potential flexibility and capacity to manage this comprehensive undertaking. To the degree the Department of Commerce lacks personnel, funding, and other support mechanisms, these resources can be reallocated, redirected, and eventually reprogrammed to the Department of Commerce to enhance its capacity to manage the CTF Initiative.<br />By moving resources to this Initiative, the Administration is giving the American public and Congress notice that business as usual will not be allowed. The notice provides them with the opportunity to buy-in on the Administration's broad vision for the country's recovery from this economic crisis. The CTF Initiative is presented as a comprehensive flexible multi-component effort, structured to meet the multi-faceted and dynamic challenges this crisis is proven to be at present. ISG believes that this is a great opportunity for this Administration to demonstrate bold leadership in a new cooperative Federalism. Additionally, this action is the Administration's opportunity to align fiscal, domestic and global commercial policies and actions to provide national stability and economic growth.<br />Action Step 2: Establish a formulary for defining communities in need due to declining economic conditions. This crisis is an evolving situation requiring the country to view its progression through varied perspectives. It is multi-dimensional in nature, contributing to the paradox of "the chicken and the egg" - which is or was first. Was the housing value decline or the slowdown in financing the first to start the declining domino effect? At this stage, the Administration is required to address this crisis at several levels at once. This CTF Initiative provides the venue to support and track multiple efforts in the pursuit of common goals and objectives for economic recovery, stability and growth. The CTF Initiative's formulary as with those for prescription drugs can address several types of situations using similar data and information that captures indicators about the conditions in various impacted communities. Some data and information in the formulary needs to address conditions of:<br /> unemployment, business, health, rate of growth of new businesses, percent of change in the number of closed businesses;<br /> communities impacted most with declining economies such as suburban, urban, rural or blended composition;<br /> community's percentage of education above high school level, GEDs, home owners, homeless, enrollees in Medicaid, receiving food stamps, other forms of public assistance; and<br /> changes in income per capita and others.<br />Implementation Strategy - 9<br />To capture this level of data and establish target areas and benchmarks for tracking progress requires the participation of many federal, state, regional and local governments and agencies and non-profit and for profit entities who collect and generate this data and information. Organizing this effort will require engaging broad representation from all levels of governments and private and non-profit entities to work together to create the components of the formulary and indicators that adequately portray the causal elements of this situation and the response to efforts redressing it.<br />Action Step 3: Provide guidelines and requirements for applicable states and local government to establish Community Trust Planning Councils (the "CTPC"). The membership of Community Trust Planning Councils need to reflect subject matter expertise in the community, as well as, the business and consumer communities in the areas impacted and affected by these economic dynamics. As a whole, the CTPC assures the community that the recovery, stabilization and growth efforts are about the entire community. More importantly, establishing these CTPCs involve the entire community in the process for recovery; promoting new ideas, trust, accountability and transparency. The CTPC will:<br /> assess the needs for and use of existing community resources;<br /> develop an area economic target recovery, stability and growth strategy and plan;<br /> recommend programs, functions and services for allocating resources and funds for a fast recovery;<br /> propose measures for sustaining the recovery;<br /> propose economic development opportunities for continued growth;<br /> monitor how the principal governance entity receiving the funds use and distribute the funds; and<br /> participate in the review and evaluation of the results and outcomes of the CTF Initiatives implemented in their area.<br />Using CTPC will ensure the attitude of "one-size fits all" will not prevail. Each of our communities is different. They are diverse and do not have the same dynamics and problems. The CTPC builds in a "fix-ability" and a "rubber hits the road" competency from its member representatives. These CTPC members will bring the nuances of living, working and playing in their communities to the table representing urban, rural, mountain, plains, desert, and lowlands locations, or diverse ethnic and social economic character.<br />In addition, employing the CTPC will free elected officials at the state, regional and local levels to focus on the ongoing concerns of the government and ensure those efforts complement and support the requirements of executing the CTF Initiative. Even though the principal governing entity is receiving and managing the funds, the CTPC provides the general guidelines and directives on how the funds are allocated and spent. This will ensure minimum conflict of interest; the entity is not supplanting available<br />Implementation Strategy - 10<br />funds by using the CTF Initiative funds (e.g., maintenance of effort and other intergovernmental fiscal policies i.e., cash management act, etc.). Applying many of the infrastructure components established for the Ryan White Title I Planning Council will serve well as a model for the establishment, role and composition of the CTPC.<br />There are mechanisms already in place that can be used and modified to get funding out the door in a timely fashion. The CTPC can:<br /> complement existing state, local, and regional governance and non-profit infrastructures (e.g., community-based organizations);<br /> provide more flexibility for these intergovernmental infrastructures to jointly plan, develop, work and fund critical initiatives in their communities;<br /> provide broader access to the decision-making process for applicable community stakeholders and consumers; and<br /> promote effective evaluations, greater accountability and transparency and feedback at all levels of government.<br />Action Step 4: A component of the CTF Initiative is establishing Jurisdictions that will serve as laboratories for developing and implementing many projects and programs demonstrating the pros and cons of various economic recovery and stabilization efforts. Establishing these laboratories ensures that the actions taken to accomplish the goals and objectives of the Community Trust Fund Initiative are actually working. The ISG recommends the establishment of at least one site per ten (10) Federal regions. Also, it is recommended that the District of Columbia be established as a site.<br />The ISG recommends the District of Columbia as an initial pilot site for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the federal government's oversight of the District's budget process. Additional reasons to pilot the CTF Initiative and the CTPC in the Washington Metropolitan Area are:<br /> the geographic size is manageable and within easy proximity;<br /> socio-economic demographics range from severe poverty to low income/moderate income, a strapped middle class, and a sizable upper income class;<br /> a failing public education system (pre-school through high-school), and a substantial number of both private pre-K to high school and private post-secondary institutions;<br /> an industrial infrastructure that needs to be retooled and expanded into green industry as well as an increasing number of underemployed and unemployed;<br />Implementation Strategy - 11<br /> an aging capital infrastructure with plans and appropriations already authorized and ready to begin (i.e., public works, transportation, housing, environmental water clean-up);<br /> areas suffering severely from foreclosed housing;<br /> an increasingly diverse racial, ethnic and linguistic population (some schools have over 26 languages spoken); and<br /> a diverse geographic population from densely populated inner city to suburban and ex-urban.<br />In many ways the Washington Metropolitan Area provides an ideal pilot laboratory site, it replicates so many of the issues that each of the ten (10) regions are presently facing, but in a relatively contained geographic area and population.<br />Over time, these regional laboratories will provide innovations and leading edge developments in economic and community development and stability. Another key responsibility of these laboratory sites is monitoring, reporting results and facilitating the transfer of experience and knowledge to other similar communities for successful replication.<br />Action Step 5: With $700 billion authorized for TARP, approximately $800 billion being considered for a recovery package, the Administration must immediately harness these resources within a comprehensive strategy to ensure effective change for the good of the USA and its global partners. It is advised that the Administration immediately redirect remaining available funds under this action to the CTF Initiative in a supplemental budget request. Assess where the dollars spent were effective, terminate ineffective programs and proposals, and where possible, reallocate remaining funds and resources to enhance the CTF Initiative's capacity.<br />Another action within the federal government is to have the Office of Management and Budget (the "OMB") look for all unobligated FY 2009 authority that can be redirected or reprogrammed to the CTF Initiative. These resources can be used to: 1) increase funding for effective current programs and efforts that address the goals and objectives of the CTF Initiative; 2) fund at-a-minimum, the ten (10) Federal regional and Washington Metropolitan Area laboratories; and 3) fund promising new projects and initiatives that will strengthen the recovery in an expeditious manner.<br />Having established the remainder of the bailout stimulus package fund and unobligated and unspent FY 2009 Federal Budget authority under a cogent comprehensive approach to remedying the nation's short and long-term economic situation, the Administration has given itself some time to develop and propose a national economic strategy in FY 2011 Budget. Review FY 2010 Budget and bring similar services, functions<br />Implementation Strategy - 12<br />and dollars associated with activities together under one program instead of the shot gun approach currently used (i.e., all VA, HUD and other housing programs can be placed in one agency).<br />The FY 2011 Budget planning and development process is critical to bring onboard all federal agencies and their resources (e.g., workforce, infrastructures and funds) to either implement components of the CTF Initiative, ensure that their programs and functions remove obstacles or complement the CTF Initiative and/or provide tertiary support to the CTF Initiative. FY 2011 is also the time to propose any agency reorganizations and staff reallocation plans for the CTF Initiative operations.<br />Action step 6: Monitor and evaluate the CTF Initiative to promptly respond and to initiate corrective actions and interventions and to skillfully fine tune the strategies and approaches. The monitoring and evaluation processes afford more effective and timely outcomes and create models for successful replication. Considering the magnitude of the expected outcomes, ongoing monitoring and evaluation ensures resources are being used at overall adequate proportional levels. This is an opportunity for this Administration to modify both the intent and use of the Government Performance and Results Act (the "GPRA") and Program Assessment Rating Tool ("PART").<br />GPRA, passed in 1993, addresses a range of issues regarding accountability and performance at the federal government level, serving as the performance measurement process required by law. This performance system principally measures an agency's performance as a result of budgetary decision-making. However, this does not necessarily address measuring and improving the agency's performance of its mission or required major initiatives.<br />The Office of Management and Budget created PART in 2002 as part of the previous Administration's effort to integrate budget and performance as a result of Congressional and the Executive Branch management and budget decisions. It is clear that the intent of both actions is to provide a way to hold the government accountable for its performance and yet, be responsive to the impact of the political nature of the federal government budget and management decision-making. Some academics consider PART a performance budgeting tool; others view it as a tool for generating performance data. There are apparent disagreements on how budget and performance data can fit or complement each other; which they can, and see conflicts between GPRA and PART. However, there has been a great investment made in data collection and reporting infrastructures for these performance measurement tools. Building off this existing infrastructure and modifying these tools to complement each other will better serve the U.S. Congress, this Administration, federal agencies, state, regional and local governments, non-profits and the<br />Implementation Strategy - 13<br />public as a whole. This very fixable situation will have far reaching impact on the effectiveness of the federal government at all levels beyond just the CTF Initiative.<br />Conclusion<br />This is a momentous time in the history of our country and the world. There are many choices before the people. We believe this Administration has an opportunity to provide a framework within which communities can make selective choices remedying their unique situations, yet, contributing to a collection of solutions for the challenges we face and a comprehensive national strategy for moving effectively forward. The USA Community Trust Fund Initiative provides the infrastructure to pave the way for repair and innovations with a united effort built on Trust.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It is an economic recovery initiative that focuses on Main Street called the USA Community Trust Fund Initiative (the "CTF Initiative"). Trust funds are generally considered instruments of security and opportunity. This CTF Initiative will incorporate the best practices and lessons learned from Federal intergovernmental efforts such as the Ryan White Care Act ("Ryan White"), Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG"), Enterprise Zones, Comprehensive Employment and Training Act ("CETA"), Homeland Security Grants to States and Federal Revenue Sharing to name a few.</div><br />	audmathews	2	4	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3557-4049

3567-4049	Rewrite Congress's Job Description	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Economists, bankers, and regulators--all failed to protect us from the financial crisis we're now facing. And they will again--because their job description does not require them to regularly review and revise the entire framework of financial regulation. But Congress might well succeed where these others have so often failed if it rewrites its own job description to include this task. Recurrent financial crises point out the need not just for a new regulatory "architecture," but for a means of renewing it on a regular basis. <br /><br />Regular review and revision would be a new task for Congress. But it falls squarely within its legislative function. It is up to Congress, not the executive branch, to decide on the purposes and overall direction of regulation. The authors of the US Constitution conceived of the separation of powers as a protection against tyranny. Reinvigorating the legislative function of Congress through a process of comprehensive regular review and revision might now be just as important as a protection against recurrent regulatory failure.<br /><br />Regular review stands in sharp contrast to a one-time reform of our financial regulatory architecture, as has been called for by President Obama. It would involve taking the time to periodically and deliberately review and--if need be--alter or "rebuild" the overall structure of financial regulation. If Congress doesn't take on the job, you can bet that over time the executive will either modify it piecemeal or, even more likely, allow the regulatory edifice to crumble. <br /><br />A regular and comprehensive process of Congressional review would help Congress and the executive concentrate on what each does best. Legislation would no longer mean simply enacting new laws, but regularly updating a system of laws and regulations so that they remained coherent--and in conformity to changing circumstances and the will of the people. Were Congress to continually update the purpose, direction, and overall structure of regulation, the executive branch would be encouraged to stick to its constitutionally specified power to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed." <br /><br />How would a regular and comprehensive Congressional review process work? <br /><br />Currently, Congress spends most of its time passing laws and engaging in detailed oversight. It builds new buildings and then occasionally checks to see if all is well in the boiler room. Regular and comprehensive Congressional review would add a new task: it would involve periodic monitoring of the entire regulatory architecture. This requires broad, systemic thinking, that is: legislative thinking. To keep pace with market innovations and help us avoid future crises it would have to incorporate three elements: review, revision, and regularity. <br /><br />Review. Review means taking stock of where you've been and how you got there. It involves a kind of global progress check in order to get a coherent view of both the full range of relevant current regulatory efforts and their past consequences. Review ensures that regulation is based on a comprehensive view. <br /><br />Revision. Revision means that regulations are actually changed when indicated by a regular process of review, not a year later or after they've developed into "crises." Regulatory revision, like the review it is based on, should be general, meant to direct the actions of multiple regulatory agencies and future legislation. Revision ensures that regulatory efforts are coordinated--that someone is supervising the supervisors. <br /><br />Regularity. Regularity means of keeping on top of changes in the environment. Regulators can all too easily get comfortable with their surroundings. Regularity--a planned regulatory review every five years, for example--ensures that regulatory innovation, should it be called for, is timely. <br /><br /> Notice the many contrasts with the path we've recently traveled. Whatever else one chooses to believe about the proximate causes of the current financial catastrophe, one thing is clear: there has been no effort to continually rebuild the entire structure of financial regulation, despite near continual and unprecedented financial innovation. At least a half a dozen different agencies are directly responsible for financial regulation. Small wonder that one hand doesn't know what the other is doing or that different hands so often work at cross purposes. And small wonder that financial wizards and other less savory characters end up taking advantages of cracks in the system. <br /><br />Regular review and revision is more than just a broader form of "oversight." It involves a comprehensive and proactive form of overview. And it packs real punch in the form general guidance that orients future regulatory and legislative action. Without this action component, regular review would perhaps illuminate much, but change very little. <br /><br />Congress is the right place to institute a process of regular review and revision of financial policy because periodic renewal of our regulatory architecture is a legislative rather than executive function. And unlike the executive agencies, Congress can accomplish periodic review through the simple expedient of majority vote. <br /><br />Congress need not conduct regular review and revision in a vacuum. Information and expertise are hardly in short supply. They could come from agencies, academic experts, or a professional advisory arm of Congress. But the final responsibility for periodic review and revision would properly rest with Congress as the people's representative. <br /><br />Greater legislative coherence, adaptability, and accountability might be resisted by some in the executive branch. Yet greater legislative clarity--at the systemic or general level--might end up encouraging the faithful execution of the law, all the more so if it were firmly rooted in independent analysis. Then, too, a regular review process might help Congress avoid being distracted by the specifics of administration. <br /><br />British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has recently called for a global financial warning and crisis prevention system. By instituting comprehensive regular review and revision, Congress can give the world an American prototype--and American citizens the protection they deserve. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Could provide a sustainable and accountable approach to financial regulation and a model for regulation in general.</div><br />	gundersen	6	8	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3567-4049

I would have liked this to go one step deeper with citizens gathering to take action locally, regionally, and nationally to support the message they submitted.<br /><br />Similar to the "Citizens Briefing Book" which can be found on www.whitehouse.gov/ope, Office of Public Engagement -- these exciting citizen ideas, are not only to be acted upon by our Federal government -- corporations can create non-partisan civic dialogue and action events, similar to how they have attached their brands, values, and budgets to help raise awareness and funds for disease-related issues, such as cancer, AIDs, etc.<br /><br />I would like to see citizens react and engage on the various ideas proposed in the "Citizens Briefing Book" -- there needs to be organized moments of consumption of this "democratic product."<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The idea of asking corporate America to help this government popularize, and create multiple and varied moments of consumption of a "national dialogue" type movement or product is arguably one of the only places we have to go ask for money to communicate the extent that we need to communicate and advertise in order to pull off even one event.<br /><br /><br /><br />It took millions of advertising and event planning dollars to elect a President - it is going to take millions of advertising and event planning dollars to have people from all walks of life engage regularly with one another and their local and federal government.<br /><br /><br /><br />Contests, rewards and awards are important incentives that corporate America can integrate.<br /><br /><br /><br />I invite you to visit www.andactiononline.com where I have piloted a few such events, minus corporate sponsors.</div><br />	veronique	13	15	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3570-4049

Who wouldn't give themselves a raise if given the choice.<br /><br />While I don't have what I consider to be the one way of determining legislators pay, I'm sure plenty of people would have some suggestions. Here is one possible idea: Legislators receive the same pay as the "average" citizen in the United States. Average should be determined by the median income, not the mean, so that extremely large income earners do not skew what the "average" citizen truly earns.<br /><br />Legislators must also pay taxes like everyone else and must not be allowed to give themselves tax exemptions.<br /><br />Legislators cannot accept positions or any other kind of income from a company who has contributed to their campaigns. <br /><br />Legislators should not receive retirement compensation in any form (other than whatever retirement they've contributed to--not a special package for politicians). Politics should not be a career. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>1) Fairness<br />2) People being in the legislator to serve the people rather than just themselves. <br />3) Help to eliminate career politicians.

3576-4049	Workforce Skills Matching - Aligning Jobs with Education System Capabilities	2009-05-27 00:00:00	President Obama's plan to make it easier for all Americans to achieve at least one year of education and training is strongly needed given our country's present skills gap. The retraining of our workforce is a priority. However, workforce regions including community colleges and training providers are facing tremendous pressure to increase the capacity and quality of training programs to produce employable workers for the new economy. At the same time, there is a lack of accurate and transparent data regarding the number of participants completing specific training programs approved for Workforce Investment Act (WIA) funding. It is challenging for our higher education system to track, implement and execute. Combine these developments with large amounts of ARRA education/training funds that will be spent in a short timeframe and this encompasses a monumental effort for all involved in the workforce development arena. <br /><br />States and regions will need to dedicate content experts and liaisons to help address this dynamic and difficult task. Limited funds are not going to be the issue. Coordination and implementation of human capital and resources along with transparent and accurate data reporting will be the greatest challenges. Coordination of key stakeholders and an increase of "feet on the street" will be necessary to accomplish this objective as well as data collection and reporting tools to aggregate and assist with the data analysis. <br /><br />This idea focuses on industry sector liaisons that can be assigned to high demand industry sectors to work in unison with State/regional workforce/economic development entities and the employer community. Data repositories, reporting tools and performance metrics will assist in transforming the present workforce investment system from a fragmented, slow changing strategy to a flexible, evolving talent pipeline with greater transparency and accountability. The consistent and continued coordination of people using technology will serve as catalysts in achieving workforce objectives.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The Department of Labor along with States and regions can no longer afford to fund programs that prepare people for jobs that are in low demand or that are sending them into the workforce without the necessary skills to be competitive.<br /><br /></div><br />	john.george	6	7	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3576-4049

3580-4049	Support Interagency Collaboration	2009-05-27 00:00:00	To support collaborative governance, agencies need to share information and expertise. Agencies need a shared platform for collaborative governance. Historically, the Administrative Conference of the United States played an important role in the growth of dispute resolution, and could serve a similar function more broadly for collaborative governance, provided it was interdisciplinary and not focused on law. Moreover, agencies need an electronic platform for sharing information and expertise.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>In the environmental area, the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution chairs an interagency working group on environmental conflict resolution, which promotes collaborative and open government activities. There is a Cooperative Conservation Partnership Memorandum of Understanding.

Moreover, there is an interagency ADR working group (www.adr.gov). However, agencies need broader infrastructure for collaborative governance.

3598-4049	Support public participation with rulemaking basics	2009-05-27 00:00:00	OMB (the Office of Management and Budget) should provide guidelines for agencies and regulations.gov on basic information for the public. Each agency should provide a home page link to rulemaking information (preferably using a standard word or phrase: test whether "rulemaking," "regulations" or another word works best for the public). At a minimum this page should include: <br />- brief explanation of rulemaking, with links to details - perhaps a tutorial on regulations.gov - and agency-specific information<br />- proposed rules and other actions the agency has open for comments, linked to background information<br />- rulemaking the agency expects in the coming months (Unified Agenda information)<br />- tips on making effective comments <br />- sign up for notification regarding specific topics and for notification of rulemaking outcomes (publication of a final rule)<br />- link to regulations.gov, for agencies, and to agencies for regulations.gov<br />- links to other agencies or sub agencies that deal with related topics<br /><br />OMB Guidance Practices Bulletin 2007 gave instructions to agencies regarding guidance documents (used to spell out policies or interpretations). Please review it: whether the substance is useful or not, the topics addressed, including what agencies must do with regard to transparency and public participation, specific attention to electronic participation, and for example the stated advantages to agencies of early involvement, would be useful for rulemaking as well!<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>- Providing good basic information and making it easy to find is a way to let the public (and the agencies) know that participation is taken seriously, and helps to make this participation more informed. <br />- The effectiveness of the 2007 OMB bulletin was suggested by the agency response - at one time (I have not checked recently) information on guidance documents seemed much easier to find on some agency Web sites than information on rulemaking!</div><br />	rgunn	12	14	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3598-4049

These details should not simply be references to arcane legal documents, but should be citizen-centric explanations of the choices to be made and the consequences.<br /><br />Similarly, agencies should have on their main portal (or on usa.gov) a comprehensive directory of services, and descriptions of all of their programs. Where a program has an effect on citizens (are there any that donâ&euro;&trade;t?), there should be a clear discussion of the effects of the program, and how the program conducts its day-to-day business. If a program is related to other programs, especially if alternatives are available to the citizen for a given service or product, these should be clearly listed, and preferably linked. For example, if funds are available for a community effort from more than one program, then the agency site should provide the citizen with guidance on the alternatives and their advantages and disadvantages (or at least their relative features).<br /><br />The intent of these policies is to provide citizens with a clear understanding of what each program does, how it does it, and what the outcomes and effects are for the citizens.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Citizens may find when doing business with the government that it is not clear what all of the policies and consequent decision criteria are for a given choice, either within a specific process (such as a loan application) or between processes.

3604-4049	Open Government Data Initiative using Innovative Technology	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Summary<br />Technology advancements like social computing and cloud computing are at the very center of making the goals of a transparent, participatory and collaborative government a reality. In this environment where government transparency is in increasing demand, many government agencies publish raw data for download from their web sites. This is essential but not enough. Making that data easily accessible and queriable by people and software is critical for making it useful. The Open Government Data initiative aims to encourage and enable data publishing by government agencies and organizations in an easily consumable form. <br /><br />What is it?: The Open Government Data Initiative (OGDI) is an open source starter kit developed by Microsoft to help government agencies publish data that can be queried by using open web programming interfaces (API's).<br /><br />Data housed in OGDI services can be accessed from a variety of client technologies such as Silverlight, Flash, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, mapping web sites, and more. OGDI enables government, business and "citizen developers" to develop real applications using government data regardless of skillset.<br /><br />Information about the initiative can be found here: http://www.microsoft.com/industry/government/opengovdata/Default.aspx<br /><br />Explore the sample site and learn about the OGDI Interactive Software Development Kit at http://ogdisdk.cloudapp.net. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The push for openness and transparency in the government space is HUGE. This, together with the requirements that agencies have for Stimulus (ARRA) activity, has generated tremendous need and interest for all solutions that can aid in this area. OGDI contributes tangible benefits to the cause of open government data by providing an innovative, easy to use open source starter kit including sample code for developers with a wide variety of Microsoft and non-Microsoft technology skills. </div><br />	nanditap	29	32	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3604-4049

3606-4049	Accountability for Government Funded Non-Profit Service Providers 	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Local governments across the United States partner with countless non-profit service organizations to provide all kinds of services to constituents - education, health, children's services, etc. The government spends billions through grants and contracts to these providers, but often does not have the capacity to ensure that these organizations are meeting their goals. For example, supplementary educational organizations that receive title I or NCLB funding may provide services that have no impact on student achievement, yet they remain funded year after year. The idea here is to create an independent organization that would support governments to monitor and hold accountable organizations that are receiving funds to provide services to the public. <br /><br />This organization would be funded by the government and foundations who also have an interest in strengthening the non-profit sector. This organization would create an information system that would 1) collect and aggregate funds that are being spent by governments on service providers 2) collect data about the intended impacts of these programs 3) monitor and evaluate these programs to understand how they are tracking back to their goals and 4) publish the data for governments and constituents so they can understand what kinds of impacts are being made, hold accountable ineffective organizations, and further support organizations that are making a positive impact. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Non-profit organizations receiving funds from the government are often supporting people who are traditionally under-served and who do not have a choice in what service provider to use, so they can't hold them accountable in the same way that someone who has a market choice can. The service provider essentially has a monopoly. Therefore, it is extremely important that the government regulates and evaluates these organizations to ensure quality. </div><br />	yasmin_fodil	10	13	3	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3606-4049

3613-4049	Data.gov 1.0 - Create practical framework for the Agencies to assess, extract, cleanse and publish data	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Open Government requires open information. That information certainly exists - more information than we can imagine (point A). Data.gov establishes a platform for publishing that data and driving innovation against that data (point C). How does the agency prudently, safely and accurately move information from point A to point C? <br /><br />First, the agency must assess which information will be published. An argument can be made that all information which does not threaten national security or violate an individual's privacy should (and will) be published at some point in time. However, common sense suggests that factors such as importance (relevance), uniqueness (system of record), accuracy, cost to extract, and other factors can suggest a prioritization. If the Agency has an active Data Governance program, this is utilized heavily.<br /><br />Next, the source(s) must be evaluated for processing strategy. Factors such as source media (yes, paper still exists as a system of record!), electronic source format (legacy, DBMS, other) and the high-level structure and format should be cataloged.<br /><br />And of utmost importance, the information must be evaluated for 1) sensitivity (i.e. are all data elements appropriate for disclosure and 2) are there any personally identifying elements which should be removed?<br /><br />Of concern to the agency will be the accuracy of the data. Particularly for systems which do not have many reporting interfaces, there can and will be data quality issues. For the data which will be extracted and published, simple data profiling should be performed to assess these issues prior to the public community discovering them.<br /><br />Next, an evaluation of readily available technologies owned by the agency and accompanied with administrative and development expertise should be performed. Tools including EAI, ETL, export utilities and more can be included. If an agency doesn't own these tools and has a limited budget, an open source approach can be considered.<br /><br />Then, a pilot program should be established. Choosing one of the high priority sources identified in the process described above, data is extracted, cleansed, profiled and published in a format compliant with data.gov. Working with data.gov, a subtle yet very important consideration will be on how the Agency can collect usage and data quality feedback from the consumers of its data. This critical feedback loop can be used to address issues at the underlying systems of record.<br /><br />Finally, as with any continuous improvement process, lessons learned should be collected. The agency process should be improved. Alternatively, new technologies and resources can be brought in, and the scope increased to include more sources, more data. This agency is now on its way to transparency, using a practical, risk-averse and evolutionary approach.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>By using a practical and iterative process which leverages a combination of best practices and existing Agency resources, the process of publishing data to the public is faster, safer and cheaper, getting the Agency to a high degree of transparency much sooner.</div><br />	Jason Nichols	5	8	3	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3613-4049	
3617-4049	limit number of ideas that a person can post per week 	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Regarding this board or future dialogue boards: a lot of space is taken up by people reposting their issue, or venting about a personal issue, or posting ideas that they have not put much thought into. It's taking a lot of work to wade through the drek in search of thoughtful, national-level proposals, and some very good ideas are being buried. <br /><br />I'd suggest a strict baseline limit on the number of posts per week. Then, give generous extra "posting credits" to people whose ideas garner support (for example, "in the top 30% of proposals," or "more than 25 votes"). People who really do have multiple great ideas retain basically unrestricted access. People with a few good ideas would be encouraged to polish them up so they are understandable and get votes. And people with bad posting habits or other problems would retain access, but on a limited basis.<br /><br />Bad postings would not count as a negative, so people would be encouraged to improve, instead of being discouraged from participating.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>True participation requires true access.

3620-4049	Develop and introduce the USA Public Freedom Act	2009-05-27 00:00:00	THE USA PUBLIC FREEDOM ACT<br />Expanding and Improving Domestic and International <br />Collaborative Governance Opportunities for All Americans<br /><br />A Proposal Summary<br /><br />Since the 1600s, U.S. citizens and Europeans have held a shared value fundamental to our democratic heritage, of what we once called, public freedom. In the U.S. and French tradition of the eighteenth century, the idea contrasted with individual or private freedom. Public freedom meant having the means to effectively and regularly exercise first amendment rights through participatory decision-making in shared governance(1). It is a term synonymous with public sphere or collaborative governance(2)--the original expression of participatory democracy. As the main group activity for maintaining civic health, it was regarded as the basis of political accountability and community. <br /><br />The USA Public Freedom Act is a transpartisan measure to strengthen deliberative democracy opportunities for U.S. citizens in each of the 435 congressional districts, including the District of Columbia and all U.S. territories. As a strategic policy framework for the participation component of the Open Government Directive, it expands opportunities for individuals of all ages to serve as collaborators in federal public policymaking. Its introduction to the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate and the White House is especially important now, when so many communities are struggling to deal with critical social, economic, and democratic deficits.<br /> <br />I. The Act Authorizes a Commission to Design Implementation Plans for Institutional Structures that Facilitate Opportunities for Americans to Regularly Participate in Collaborative Governance to Craft Federal Policy: To build on the success stories across the globe of deliberative democracy in the service of federal collaborative governance, whereby federal policymaking partners with citizen-initiated policymaking, this first provision of the Act authorizes the creation of a focused Commission. The Commission will within three months of the Act's passage:<br />• Develop and present to the U.S. Congress an institutional plan of implementation for the institutionalization of several measures for the Open Government Directive, including measurements of progress and evaluations of effectiveness. <br />• Survey the results and apply the lessons of Open Government from around the globe, including, but not limited to the following: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's tools for democratic watershed collaboration; the work of dialogue and deliberation in European Citizen Consultations; and the Citizens' Parliament of Australia. Craft recommendations and action plans, including budgets for a Presidential Delegation consisting of 50 members representing all 50 U.S. states and territories, dedicated to identifying targeting resources to new, untested community organizations that seek to connect the input from and results of deliberative democracy programs to federal government policymaking schedules. <br /><br />Footnotes:(1)Arendt, Hannah, On Revolution (New York: Viking Press, 1963; Penguin Books, 2006), 109. Arendt writes, "If the men who, on both sides of the Atlantic, were prepared for the revolution had anything in common…it was a passionate concern for public freedom much in the way Montesquieu or Burke spoke about it…" <br />(2)Weil, Frank A. The Weil Program on Collaborative Governance at Harvard University. Collaboration, as an equitable working partnership at the international level, occurs frequently in Track II and cultural diplomacy already serves the purpose of negotiated resolutions under the same ethic: Namely, non-officials (academic scholars, retired civil servants and military officials, public figures, social activists, etc.) engage in dialogue and deliberation with the aim of conflict resolution or confidence-building.<br /><br />• Recommend a Fellowship program for scholars focused on pioneering interdisciplinary, institutional implementation plans for embedding permanent structures for cross-sector and intra-sector collaboration among foundations, federal institutions, local and state governments, institutions of learning, the private sector, etc. related enhancing simultaneously specific areas of national need such as Education, the Public Sphere, Open Government, and Government Ethics and Accountability. <br /><br />II. The Act Establishes a New Federal Mandate for the Office of Public Engagement to Empower All U.S. Communities with One Centrally Located Local Public Assembly Center for Collaborative Governance: The White House Office of Public Engagement will within three months of the Act's passage:<br />• Expand and the enhance the public sphere(3) by recruiting 250,000 U.S. citizens as national deliberative democracy participants to 250,000/year via outreach, information/ communication technologies (ICT) and an annual nation-wide town meeting series of 100 meetings in all 50 U.S. continental states. As part of a new national commitment to addressing national challenges in health care, education, climate change, foreign affairs, and the global economic crisis.<br />• Devote $50,000,000.00/year for U.S. National Deliberations of one federal policy the public votes to pursue and incorporate plans from several established and emerging nonprofit organizations, consultants, and scholars, including the Democracy Delegates Demonstration Project (for summary plan see www.democracydelegates.org) inspired by the Federal Forum Project of 1932-39, sponsored by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the U.S. Office of Education.<br />• Establish one memorial to the history of Open Government in a location to be voted by the American people.<br />• Communicate via a Presidential Address that this Act should be taken as a multi-generational solution, imagining the next generation of civic engagement as a systematic means to enhance public policy-making standards and accountability--the results of Open Government. <br />• Provide funding for a national convention to convene all of the cross-sector collaborators involved in the Demonstration Project called Democracy Delegates. As a national initiative, it seeks to extend the responsibilities of representative democracy to local citizens who could individually bridge the divide between the legislative process and citizen deliberation that optimizes the policy maturation process. As a first step, after the Act's passage, a diverse group of scholars, students, NGO professionals, teachers, foundation leaders, news media professionals, Capitol Hill staffers, retirees, technologists, as well and dialogue and deliberation practitioners and various collaborators will collaborate in strategic, project planning sessions at a national convention. The convention would be dedicated to convening representatives of civic engagement across the country to deliberate resolutions and joint-responsibilities for a pilot project version of a nation-wide forum series with members of Congress, tentatively called, Democracy Delegates. <br /><br />Footnote: (3)The public sphere is an area in social life where people can get together and freely discuss and identify societal problems, and through that discussion influence political action.<br /><br />• Creates the Obama Education Award of $7,000 to keep up with the rising cost of college, and links it to Pell Grants so it will continue to increase in the future. The Award can be used for pay for higher education, including student loans for students in full or part-time programs involving undergraduate or graduate coursework related to advancing the capacity of congressional districts and their communities to create and sustain deliberative democracy, focused on community organizing, volunteerism, civic engagement, deliberative democracy, political communication, public policy, philosophy, sociology, or information technology.<br /><br />III. Support Increased Collaborative Governance Opportunities for Students. Public service toward open government early in life will put more youth on a path to a lifetime of service enhancing the results of government business. The Act: <br /><br />• Strengthens the current program of the Partnership for Public Service and the National Academy of Public Administration, as well as other institutions, and authorizes a Summer of Inter-Agency with the White House Office of Public Engagement and the Office of Science and Technology for high school seniors.<br /> <br />IV. Support Increased Collaborative Opportunities for Retirees. Many retiring citizens are ready, willing, and able to be involved in deliberative democracy and collaborative, federal priority-setting, agenda-setting, and policymaking and have skills needed by our communities. The Act:<br />• Strengthens and expands the financial and social capital of all current NCDD U.S. members--scholars and practitioners alike - to implement deliberative democracy experiments that build the capacity and service delivery resources and permanent structures necessary to sustain and enhance the delivery of open government transparency, collaboration, and participation.<br />• Enhances incentives for retirees to give a year of public service through the new Office of Public Engagement (OPE), by enabling them to transfer their educational award to a child or grandchild. <br />• Creates OPE Fellowships to help retirees participate in longer-term open government public service. <br /> <br />V. Support Increase of Volunteerism for Collaborative Governance by Persons All Ages. Many Americans who are not able to make a significant time commitment to collaborative policymaking or information sharing can offer their public service in other ways. The legislation:<br />• Expands the volunteer pool by establishing a "Millennial Generation Fund" to assist nonprofit organizations in recruiting and managing additional volunteers from high schools whose students have the option to pursue formal civics courses. For every high school student who participates in the program, an additional $2,000 shall be disbursed from the U.S. Department of Education to high schools who agree to allocate the funds into an endowment for preserving secondary civics education. <br /> <br />VI. Support Innovation and Collaboration in the Public-Private Sector: Entrepreneurs who have launched innovative organizations or businesses such as Mediators Foundation, AmericaSpeaks/Global Voices, Ashoka, IDEO, the Drucker Institute--to name just a few--are experimenting with new solutions to pressing problems. The Act:<br />• Recognizes and supports the effective role of social entrepreneurs in meeting community and national challenges by establishing an "Open Government Fund" to serve as venture capital to help the nonprofit sector seed new, untested nonprofits, recruit talent, and collaborate with each other and the private sector in connecting public consensus on policy with government-initiated legislation schedules and implementation efforts.<br />• Allocates $250,000,000.00/year equally among the U.S. states and territories. A full twenty percent of this fund shall be allocated to annual state-wide town meetings that incorporate the best methods of community organizing, dialogue, deliberation, and collaboration among members of the public as a whole, inclusive of people from all walks of life. A full ten percent of the investment shall be put toward additional revenue generating mechanisms such as for-profit enterprises, individual donor strategies, and the pooling of foundation and individual peer-to-peer funds across U.S. communities.<br /> <br />VII. Intra-Executive Branch Collaboration: The Act strengthens inter-agency and inter-commission collaboration by devoting federal dollars to public-private partnerships via federal contracts. The legislation:<br />• Charges the Open Government Commission to identify existing public and private sector firms able and willing to assist the White House in convening interactive, innovative group process fora for the purpose of providing agencies increased opportunities to participate in policymaking and to provide their Government with the benefit of their collective expertise and information. <br />• Charges the Open Government Commission to convene a series of meetings for a Open Agency Coalition of leaders and their staff from a sample of the following independent federal agencies, including the traditional non-independent entities such as the Dept. of Defense: <br />o National Endowment for the Humanities<br />o National Endowment of the Arts<br />o Government Accountability Office<br />o U.S. Institute of Peace<br />o The International Atomic Energy Agency<br />o Office of Government Ethics<br />o Peace Corps<br />o U.S. Institute of Peace<br />o Presidential Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board <br />o Postal Service Board of Governors<br />o U.S. Extension Service<br />o U.S. Libraries<br />o Corporation for Public Broadcasting<br /><br />• Provides $1,000,000.00 to the Open Government Commission to facilitate the Open Agency Coalition's ability to create an implementation plan and budget for making Government more collaborative with one year of this Act's passage. Specifically, the purpose of such meetings shall facilitate the ability of participants to work together in the service of collaborative governance toward creating a plan for increased, regular and productive opportunities in deliberative democracy within every U.S. political jurisdiction (city or township) concerning every piece of federal legislation on the White House and U.S. Congress docket. <br />• Provides $50,000.00 for each congressional office to hire one public liaison or collaborative legislative affairs staff person to convene congressional district constituent-based policymaking with public officials for joint-policymaking and working partnership in the delivery of services and the consent of the governed per policy per political jurisdiction. <br /><br /><br />VIII. Support International Collaborative Governance Opportunities: The Act strengthens the current "Track II" or "Smart Power" programs of the U.S. Institute of Peace and the U.S. Department of State, or the National Endowment for Democracy, which coordinates and supports short-term international citizen-diplomacy opportunities for skilled professionals in developing nations. The Act: <br />• Recognizes and supports the emerging the cross-sector learning collaborative in the field of diplomatic and policymaking experiments, called the Global Leadership Laboratory (GL2), currently under the auspices of the EastWest Institute and the Mediators Foundation. <br />• Supports the efforts of the GL2 to create an environment in which decision-makers' capabilities are optimized, which currently does not exist. Therefore, the U.S. Department of State shall allocate $40,000,000.00 to fund its development and implementation, including the participation of one-hundred U.S. Federal managers both inside and outside of the U.S. Department of State, including U.N. liaisons, to devote on average at least 5 hours a week toward tackling international collaborative governance or policymaking among nations. The fund divided equally in $10,000,000.00 increments to five dimensions of the project will address the following four dimensions of the project:<br />o Principle 1. Includes all strategically relevant perspectives in real time. The network of conveners of the Lab will be so diverse geographically and politically that stakeholders could be systematically and rapidly included in the conversation.<br />o Principle 2. Employs state-of-the-art visual data management and presentation methods. (GL2) will set a new standard for including global problem-solving software, skillful human-computer interface, GeoEye and Google Earth geographic data, etc.<br />o Principle 3.Applies remote meeting technologies for rapid convening of virtual conversations. By using either Hewlett Packard's HALO Systems technologies or Cisco's TELEPRESENCE tools, (GL2) will enable almost anyone anywhere to be "present" at short notice.<br />o Principle 4. Organizes and designs workspace that invigorates, catalyzes and inspires. Unlike current venues, (GL2) will bring in the environmental attributes that have been proven to raise levels of human performance.<br /><br />IX. Support the Construction of One Building for Deliberative Democracy: The White House Office of Public Engagement will within one year of the Act's passage:<br />• Support the effort to host and facilitate a design competition and construction of one 10,000-20,000 sq. foot building dedicated deliberative democracy and open government. The building shall provide indoor and outdoor environments in which citizens' capabilities for dialogue and deliberation toward democratic participation and collaboration in the process of local, state, and federal policymaking are optimized. Therefore, the U.S. Department of Education shall allocate $30,000,000.00 to fund its development, implementation, and programmatic maintenance, including the participation of fifty U.S. local public officials of the political jurisdiction surrounding the physical site of the building, including White House liaisons, to devote on average at least 5 hours a week toward facilitating the national collaborative governance or policymaking process for government-to-citizen constructive partnership. The location of the building shall be determined by a citizens' panel made of fifty-one citizens, one form each continental U.S. State, including the District of Columbia. <br /><br />Author of USA PUBLIC FREEDOM ACT: Alexander D.

3621-4049	a proactive Transparency Officer at each agency	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Each agency should have a staff member who is responsible for seeking out and publishing agency records and databases online to the greatest degree possible.<br /><br />PROBLEM: The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is inherently a reactive process rather than a proactive process. A FOIA officer's job entails reacting when someone requests a document or record from an agency. The public does not always know what records are available. Most agencies currently have no individual or individuals tasked with the responsibility for proactively making records available, other than public affairs staff members who have responsibilities that are not necessarily consistent with this objective. Currently, even when an agency employee believes that certain types of records should be public, it is not always easy to get the records published on the agency website. Some records that would be useful to the public, and which would be releasable if requested, are available only on internal, employees-only intranet websites, and the public has no way to find out they even exist.<br /><br />SOLUTION: Every Agency should be required to have a Transparency Officer, just as they do a FOIA Officer. The Transparency Officer would be responsible for proactively making available to the public the Agency's records (documents, databases, reports, meeting minutes, etc.) In contrast to FOIA, the proactive Transparency Officer's job begins the instant records are assembled within the agency, or even when they are created. He or she must be constantly thinking, "What data and documents does our Agency have, and how can we best and most transparently share them with the public?" One advantage of performing this function would be a reduction in the number of FOIA requests and the need for such requests because the information would already be posted online.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The promotion of transparency needs an advocate or champion within each agency. This would help make many federal agency records available to the public. Currently, there is no real independent impetus for publication of many useful agency records, and even if someone happened to find out about an important records set and requested it, it would not necessarily be made available to the public.</div><br />	mikerav	23	28	5	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3621-4049	
3623-4049	Electronic Posting of Automatically Declassified Documents	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Problem: In 1995, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12958, which, among other things, required that classified documents more than 25 years old be automatically declassified unless they were specifically exempted from this requirement. Since this time hundreds of millions of pages of documents have been declassified. But where are they? Currently there is no online access to these declassified documents. Many of them exist in paper form only, and for these, there is not even an on-line index. Some electronic documents exist only in special access rooms (vs. being on the Internet), such as the CIA's "CREST" database held captive at the National Archives in College Park and not accessible to anyone who is not physically on site. Documents that are declassified but unposted and unindexed might as well not exist.<br /><br />Solution: Require every agency to post on its web site electronic copies of all documents declassified under automatic declassification guidelines. If the documents do not exist in electronic form then the agency should either scan them or post an electronic index to the non-electronic documents.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The vast majority of declassified documents are for all intents and purposes not available to the public. These documents are of immense historical and public value and the creation and declassification of these records were paid for with taxpayer funds.</div><br />	mikerav	37	40	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3623-4049	
3625-4049	Increase gasoline tax, decrease payroll tax	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Our appetite for oil contributes to our having the largest per capita carbon emission of major economies, makes us vulnerable to energy imports, and leads to a lifestyle which is ill adapted to changes in oil availability. The easiest and most direct way to address this is to increase the gasoline tax. Unlike CAFE or cap and trade this gives the price signal directly to the user. In inflation adjusted terms we pay less in gasoline taxes than we did 50 years ago. We have the cheapest gasoline in the developed world, primarily because we've externalized all costs possible. But externalized costs are real costs all the same, and are paid elsewhere. <br /><br />This is a regressive tax, so a restructuring of either payroll or income taxes is necessary to counterbalance the effects on the poor and middle class. But it needs to be done, and done quickly: oil is priced on the margin, and as the economy recovers oil prices will rise quickly and will likely strangle any recovery. We must buffer ourselves from oil shocks, and the easiest way to do that is to become less dependent on it. We also need to invest in sustainable energy technologies before we are forced to buy it from overseas.<br /><br />This will no doubt be a very difficult sell. But given the costs to climate change, economic recovery, and national security it is necessary to act.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>We must reduce our carbon emissions, we must be less sensitive to oil price shocks, we need to recognize that the use of oil has ramifications far beyond miles/gallon, and we must do it in a way that will not hurt the poor and middle class.</div><br />	alefnot	16	23	7	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3625-4049	
3627-4049	Require Web Sites That Provide Greater Explanatory Materials	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Federal agencies must pay the Federal Register by the page for the length of their rulemaking preambles & rules. Thus a Register NPRM is far from a complete recital of the materials supporting a rulemaking proposal. As a consequence agencies should use the Web to supplement the Register.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Many agencies have taken this step but they often do not do so in a manner that is designed to educate the public about the complexities of a particular rule. When a rule is economically significant or other significant under the Unified Agenda criteria an agency should at a minimum design a web page that explains the proposal to the public at large.<br /><br />One great example of this dates back to the Clinton Administration and the roadless rulemaking. The Forest Service developed a Web site that let you see the roadless areas in each National Forest. Thus the entire nation had an opportunity to see the scope of this rulemaking and submit comments on national forest areas of concern to them. Even with Regulations.gov the public at large would have had no idea where the roadless areas are from just examining an online docket.<br /><br />As those who are familiar with the Register know, its prose is often dense. A web site can highlight the key issues and point individual commenters and state and/or local NGOs to key documentation in the docket that would explain an issue in greater detail. This should increase the quality of participation by educating the public about what the agency is planning to do.<br /><br />I think this should be a default rule for big regulatory packages. Obviously this does not touch the vast number of rules that agencies work on but where the rule is significant an agency would have to assume a greater burden of speaking non-regulatese.</div><br />	bbrandon	8	9	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3627-4049	
3628-4049	Promote the Expansion of the Exchange Network Model to Improve Data Access and Transparency	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The National Environmental Information Exchange Network (http://www.exchangenetwork.net) is a secure, standards-based system for sharing information about the environment. Partners on the Exchange Network, including U.S. EPA, states, tribes, and territories, use XML and other internet technologies to share and publish data on air, water, wastes, and other information related to the environment. Since data are made available in a standard format, the Exchange Network can become a powerful tool for improving the efficiency and transparency of environmental management and can expand access to higher quality environmental data. <br /><br />Data consumers can build new tools to mash-up available data sets from the Exchange Network and present new ways of viewing and analyzing information. For example, emergency responders in several states are now using a tool that can reach across organizational lines to gather and display real-time environmental data in Google Earth. Emergency planners can quickly identify potential dangers posed by chemical inventories or hazardous waste storage. In minutes, response teams can assess threats to drinking water infrastructure or other environmental interests. <br /><br />The Administration should continue to promote the use and expansion of the Exchange Network and consider adopting the model in other Federal agencies and for feeding environmental information to the Data.gov website.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	kabhold	7	8	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3628-4049

For example:<br /><br />- the "Abstract" item on regulations.gov "document details" pages ("Summary" might be a better word) is often not filled in, or contains something other than a summary. There should be a dependable place - that is, the same place for all agencies - where the public can find a short description of what aq document is about. <br />- even with full-text search, the standards for the information agencies supply to describe their documents (metadata standards) should be reviewed for regulations.gov as a whole, not just for individual agencies. <br />- agencies should have help and incentives to increase the accuracy of their data.

3631-4049	Ways to improve FOIA and MDR Implementation	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Problem: The current implementation of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR) law leave much to be desired. In many cases agencies make only rudimentary efforts to comply with the FOIA and MDR laws, or impose hurdles and barriers that make it difficult for all but the most diligent and experienced requesters to undertake the process fruitfully.<br /><br />Solution: I suggest the following changes to the implementation of FOIA and MDR. These proposed changes are each small but, taken together, should have a dramatic impact on improving government transparency under FOIA and MDR:<br /><br />• Require all agencies to accept FOIA and MDR requests via electronic mail and web-based forms (as well as fax and paper mail).<br /><br />• Require all agencies to provide requesters with meaningful quarterly status reports regarding any requests more than three months old.<br /><br />• Require all agencies to include a phone number to the FOIA Officer in all correspondence, along with the FOIA Case number for any request.<br /><br />• Cease the continuing and shameless abuse of the "low (b)(2)" exemption, where agencies invoke this exemption in a way that is contrary to Justice Department guidance and which unnecessarily keeps requesters from the records they seek.<br /><br />• Require higher standards and better training of agencies who wish to invoke the b(5) exemption. Most agencies apply this exemption without applying all the proper legal criteria and as a result deny access to records that should be released in whole or part.<br /><br />• Discourage agencies from requiring requesters to use "magic words" to obtain records. (As an example, for years the FBI has required requesters to specifically state that they are requesting a search of the "manual indices" if they want a complete search; yet the magic words "manual indices" were never explained or even mentioned on the FBI's web site).<br /><br />• Improve MDR documentation published by agencies on their websites. Mandatory Declassification Review is an effective tool for many requests but is poorly documented. As a result, many requesters (and often, many agencies) are unsure how to deal with MDR requests or the requisite deadlines. Each agency should specifically identify the procedures and deadlines for MDR requests and appeals.<br /><br />• Encourage agencies to make fee waiver determinations without requiring a litany of obvious cookie cutter points.<br /><br />• Require agencies to revise their FOIA regulations to incorporate the most recent changes to the law that took effect during the last two years. No agencies have yet done so.<br /><br />• Require that each agency carry out the obligation to post frequently requested records in an electronic FOIA reading room. Most agencies have not done this in any meaningful manner. Agencies are selective on which frequently requested records they publish - some agencies publish only records that are favorable and not records that are critical.<br /><br />• Each agency should be required to actually publish online, as is required under the FOIA statute, a list of major agency recordkeeping systems. Despite the legal obligation, even after several years most agencies don't do this.<br /><br />• Agencies should publish their Freedom of Information Act Case Logs on a regular basis. The FOIA Case Logs are a listing of the FOIA requests received by an agency, and may contain the date and disposition of the request, the subject matter of the request, etc.<br /><br />• Requesters should have ALL fees waived for any requests that take more a certain number of years to complete, for example requests that take more than four years.<br /><br />• Given the fact that agencies frequently take years to reply to a request, agency regulations should not require the requester to submit a copy of the original request letter as part of the appeal submission. Some agencies require such a copy as part of an appeal and will reject any appeal if a copy is not provided.<br /><br />• Revisit the idea that agencies can charge unrealistic duplication fees for records they release. Ten cents a page is realistic. Twenty cents or more is not realistic and imposes barriers to public access. Agencies should not, as some astonishingly do, impose per page charges for copies of electronic records. The National Archives should not be permitted to charge 75 cents per page for photocopies.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Operation of the Freedom of Information Act could be improved substantially if these often-frustrating barriers to access were corrected.</div><br />	mikerav	14	17	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3631-4049	
3632-4049	Improve Transparency in the Executive Office of the President	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Transparency should begin at the top, in President Obama's own office. Public access to information about the functioning of the Executive Office of the President (EOP) and many of its components plays a critical role in meeting the president's commitment to creating "an unprecedented level of openness in Government." Accordingly, the administration should, to the extent possible, make the records of non-agency components of the EOP publicly available. <br /><br />As part of this effort, the administration should go back to the practice of all prior administrations -- except that of George W. Bush -- of treating the Office of Administration (OA) as an agency subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). From its inception in 1977 until August 2007, this EOP component functioned consistently as an agency subject to the FOIA, adopting comprehensive FOIA regulations and processing hundreds of FOIA requests. In August 2007, the Bush administration abruptly changed course and declared OA is not an agency and therefore need not comply with information requests under FOIA, a decision recently upheld by a federal appeals court. As part of the president's commitment to transparency and accountability, the White House should return to the policies and practices of all prior administrations and treat OA records as subject to the FOIA.<br /><br />Similarly, the administration should abandon the previous administration's practice of treating White House visitor logs as presidential records, allowing them to be processed under the FOIA by the Secret Service, the agency that creates and maintains the records. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington	30	34	4	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3632-4049

3635-4049	Implement Effective Oversight of Federal Agency Compliance with Statutory Record Keeping Obligations	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Transparency can only be effective if government agencies properly preserve and maintain their records. To this end, federal law mandates that all agencies make and preserve records that document the organizationâ&euro;&trade;s policies, decisions, and essential transactions. The law further requires every agency to establish a program for preserving its records; control the creation, maintenance, and use of records; and safeguard against the removal or loss of records. Federal agencies, however, have not complied with these obligations, and have failed to preserve records that would otherwise be publicly available. Agencies have been particularly lax in preserving and maintaining electronic records.<br /><br />The administration should implement effective oversight of agency record keeping practices. To help achieve this goal, the administration should ensure that the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) fulfills its affirmative statutory obligations related to federal agency oversight. Federal law imposes on NARA the mandatory responsibility to guide and assist agencies with record keeping. In furtherance of these duties, NARA must, among other things, conduct inspections or surveys of agency records and records management programs and practices. NARA has, however, failed to conduct any inspections of agency records since 2000, and the U.S. General Accounting Office has identified this failure as a significant contributing factor to agency non-compliance with record keeping requirements.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington	19	20	1	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3635-4049	
3636-4049	Require Public Disclosure of all Communications with Executive Branch Officials Regarding Recovery Act Funds	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The administration should require disclosure of all outside contacts with agency officials regarding the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). In February, President Obama signed the Recovery Act, which provides more than $350 billion in spending. To ensure that all Recovery Act funds are expended in a transparent and responsible manner, President Obama issued a memorandum on March 20, 2009, restricting registered lobbyists from having oral communications with executive branch officials about particular Recovery Act projects, and requiring disclosure of other oral and written communications with lobbyists about the Recovery Act.<br /><br />The administration can increase transparency by rescinding the restrictions on oral communications with registered lobbyists, and expanding the disclosure requirements to include all communications with executive branch officials related to the Recovery Act. Although the ban was imposed for a laudable goal, it leaves in place a major loophole by continuing to permit lobbying by those who are not federally registered lobbyists, but who still have a direct pecuniary interest in the disbursement of Recovery Act funds. <br /><br />A much stronger alternative is for the administration to disclose any and all communications â&euro;&ldquo; written and oral, over the phone and in-person â&euro;&ldquo; regarding Recovery Act funds. Agencies should post on their websites the names and business affiliations of all persons engaging in the communications, the names and positions of the government officials with whom the conversations took place, the dates of the communications, and the subject matter of the discussions. These expanded disclosure requirements will not impose a significant burden on agency officials, who are already required to make these disclosures for communications with registered lobbyists about general Recovery Act issues.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington	22	25	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3636-4049

3641-4049	Ensure Implementation and Enforcement of FOIA and Deter Backsliding	2009-05-27 00:00:00	115 participants from 18 countries in the Americas, representing governments, civil society organizations, international and regional bodies and financial institutions, donor agencies and foundations, the private sector, media outlets and scholars, gathered in Lima, Peru from April 28-30, 2009, under the auspices of The Carter Center, in collaboration with the Organization of American States, the Andean Commission of Jurists and the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, to advance the right of access to information in the region.<br /><br />The assembled conference made a number of findings and suggested plans of action relevant to the United States, such as <br /><br />1. States have a special obligation to disclose information pertaining to human rights violations or corruption. This is all the more important in the Americas regional context of past state-sponsored or approved human rights violations and the more recent â&euro;&oelig;global war on terror,â&euro;? whereby systematic torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment has been allowed to flourish under the veil of state secrets. <br /><br />Claims of state secrets, national security, diplomatic relations or related grounds to shield information regarding human rights violations must be subject to review by a civilian court or other body that is fully independent of the executive branch. Claims should only be upheld where (a) the independent body has the opportunity to review the information sought to be suppressed, (b) disclosure of the information would demonstrably harm a legitimate national security interest, and (c) the restriction imposed is the least restrictive means possible for protecting that interest.<br /><br />2. Increasing government capacity and strengthening administrative practices to respond to requests and make information proactively available will help support the realization of the right of access to information and can serve to raise confidence in the system, which may further foster demand. <br /><br />3. Although technology can assist access to information, it is not a panacea. States use of websites and new technologies is but one avenue for dissemination rather than a substitute for meaningful access to information whereby all persons have the right to seek and receive information regardless of the medium.<br /><br />4. In light of the global economic meltdown, private organizations have become significant beneficiaries of public funds and so must increasingly be covered by targeted transparency requirements. Transparency in these organizations will allow for greater accountability, improved administration, and increased consumer and investor confidence.<br /><br />5. The scope of access to information laws should cover key institutions and bodies and these should be subject to the full requirements of disclosure, including:<br /><br />a) Central banks and those responsible for the development of monetary policy; <br />b) Private sector bodies that provide public services or receive public funding; <br />c) Political parties and movements registered in the electoral system; and<br />d) Judicial and Legislative branches of government.<br /><br />6. To ensure effective implementation and enforcement of FOIA, the government should:<br /><br />a) Designate a specific budget for each public body covered under the law to implement and sustain the necessary procedures;<br /><br />b) Increase capacity and resources for Information/Access Officers and Archival and Records Managers, including training and professionalization;<br /><br />c) Afford specialized training for all public officials in the areas of record-making, storage, retrieval and delivery; <br /><br />d) Ensure clear guidelines for classification of documents to minimize discretion;<br /><br />e) Sustain proactive disclosure measures; <br /><br />f) Strengthen reporting requirements related to operation of the law; <br /><br />g) Perform periodic evaluations of the efficiency and effectiveness of the information regulations, institutions and practice; <br /><br />h) Share best practices and collaborating across public agencies; and<br /><br />i) Encouraging the use of technology, as appropriate.<br /><br />6. The US government should strive to build confidence in the system through:<br /><br />a) Ensuring that requests receive timely and satisfactory responses; <br />b) Providing effective and enforceable sanctions for inappropriate denials, obstructing requests for and receipt of information, and all other failures to comply with the right to information regime; and<br />c) Establishing appropriate enforcement measures.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>NOTE: ALSO POSTED UNDER UNCATEGORIZED<br /><br /><br /><br />At present the US FOIA only covers the Executive Branch, lacks a strong oversight body, is not being fully implemented, and is difficult to enforce (as requesters denied information must apply to US Federal Court, which is expensive and slow).</div><br />	The Carter Center	30	36	6	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3641-4049	
3642-4049	Advance the Right of Access to Information through Adherence to Basic Principles and Full Implementation	2009-05-27 00:00:00	A group of over 125 members of the global access to information community from over 40 countries, representing governments, civil society organizations, international bodies and financial institutions, donor agencies, foundations, private sector companies, media outlets and scholars, gathered in Atlanta, Georgia from February 27-29, 2008, under the auspices of the Carter Center and adopted the Atlanta Declaration and Plan of Action for the Advancement of the Right of Access to Information. <br /><br />The Atlanta Declaration included key principles to advance the implementation, enforcement, and exercise of the right of access to information. Unfortunately, the United States Freedom of Information Act does not meet these basic tenets. We encourage amendements to the US FOIA and its policies in order to meet the international norms, including the following:<br /><br />Legal Tenets:<br /><br />a. Access to information is the rule; secrecy is the exception;<br /><br />b. The right of access to information should apply to all branches of government (including the executive, judicial and legislative bodies, as well as autonomous organs) at all levels (federal, central, regional and local);<br /><br />c. The right of access to information should extend to non-state actors that: receive public funds or benefits (directly or indirectly); carry out public functions, including the provision of public services; and exploit public resources, including natural resources. The right of access to information extends only to the use of those funds or benefits, activities or resources;<br /><br />d. The right of access to information should include a right to request and receive information, and a positive obligation on public institutions to disseminate information related to their core function;<br /><br />e. The right to request information is independent of a personal interest in that information, and there should never be a need to provide a justification or reason;<br /><br />f. The instrument or law should include procedures designed to ensure the full implementation and ease of use, with no unnecessary obstacles (such as cost, language, form or manner of request) and with an affirmative obligation to assist the requester and to provide the requested information within a specified and reasonable period of time;<br /><br />g. Exemptions to access to information should be narrowly drawn, specified in law, and limited only to those permitted by international law. All exemptions should be subject to a public interest override, which mandates release of otherwise exempt documents when the public benefit of release outweighs the potential public harm;<br /><br />h. The burden of proof to justify a denial should always falls on the holder of information;<br /><br />i. The law should include clear penalties and sanctions for non-compliance by public officials; and<br /><br />j. The requester should be guaranteed a right to appeal any decision, any failure to provide information, or any other infringement of the right of access to information to an independent authority with the power to make binding and enforceable decisions, preferably an intermediary body such as an Information Commission(er) or Specialist Ombudsman in the first instance with a further right of appeal to a court of law.<br /><br />Effectively Implementing the FOIA:<br /><br />The United States government should ensure a system of implementation that provides for:<br /><br />a. The equitable exercise of the right of access to information; <br /><br />b. Training of all public officials on the practice and application of the right; <br /><br />c. Public education and training to empower persons to make full use of the law;<br /><br />d. Allocation of necessary resources to ensure efficient and timely administration;<br /><br />e. Strengthening of information management to facilitate access to information; <br /><br />f. Regular monitoring and reporting on operation of the law; and<br /><br />g. Review of the operation and compliance with the law, by legislative and key oversight bodies.<br /><br />Moreover, companion legislation that would further promote the right of access to information and provide a supportive legislative framework should be enacted, including: laws compelling disclosure of political party and campaign financing; lobbying disclosure; archiving legislation; whistleblowing protection; and professional public administration laws. Moreover, contradictory provisions, such as those contained within an Official Secrets Act, should be repealed.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>NOTE: ALSO POSTED UNDER UNCATEGORIZED</div><br />	The Carter Center	24	29	5	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3642-4049

3648-4049	TAKE BACK THE POWER TO CREATE MONEY FROM THE PRIVATE BANKING INDUSTRY	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The Constitution states, "Congress shall have the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof." This power has been abdicated to private bankers. Today, 99.99% of our money is created by private banks when they make loans. This includes the Federal Reserve, a private banking corporation, which orders Federal Reserve Notes to be printed, and then lends them to the U.S. government. Only coins are actually created by the government itself. Coins compose only about 1-10,000th of the M3 money supply, and Federal Reserve Notes compose about 3% of it. All of the rest is created by banks as loans, something they do by simply writing numbers into accounts. <br /><br />Congress could take back the power to create the national money supply by:<br />(a) Nationalizing the Federal Reserve.<br />(b) Reviving the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a government-owned lending facility used by Roosevelt to fund the New Deal. Rather than merely recycling borrowed money as Roosevelt did, however, the RFC could actually create credit on its books, in the same way that banks do it today, by fanning its capital base into many times that sum in loans. Assuming $300 billion is left of the TARP money approved by Congress last fall, this money could be deposited into the RFC and leveraged into $3 trillion in loans. That's based on a 10% reserve requirement. If the money were counted as capital, at an 8% capital requirement it could be leveraged into 12.5 times the original sum. That would be enough to fund not only President Obama's stimulus package but many other programs that are desperately short of funding now. <br /><br />Many references are available which will be furnished on request.

The use of encryption and non-monitorable radio systems by government agencies must end.<br /><br />In many communities, police, fire and other emergency radio signals have been monitored by reporters, private citizens and other government employees since they started to be used. Now there are several radio systems in use by public agencies that "can not" be monitored (typically they are proprietary and techical information is not available) or they have switched to digitally encrypted signals.

The medical privacy rulemaking during the end of the Clinton Administration and some rules at the NMFS used a system whereby comments could be posted under individual parts of the preamble and the proposed rule text.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This type of technological approach encourages one commenter to focus on the views of another commenter and respond to their thoughts as well as to comment on the substance of the proposal. While a consensus on a proposal is not always achievable this type of technology would make it easier for this to occur. Indeed the GAO reported that several agencies had noticed this in its first report on electronic rulemaking.<br /><br />The present uniform architecture of Regulations.gov prevents this type of experimentation. Web technology is too fluid to have it remain in the straight jacket of the present system. I would hope that OMB would see the wisdom of greater experimentation in this area.</div><br />	bbrandon	1	7	6	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3657-4049	
3658-4049	Reduce the effectiveness of the Federal government	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Back when the USA was being formed, it was really just a bunch of INDIVIDUAL states that wanted strength and protection from outsiders (other countries). The original idea was to let each state "do its own thing" with little intervention from a single Federal government. When did things go so wrong?<br /><br />Currently there are dozens (hundreds?) of Federal Laws that are essentially similar to, or even often contradict, state laws. This is a total waste of taxpayer money and government effort. One quick example I'll give pertains to marijuana - voted legal for medicinal use in California yet still against Federal Law.<br /><br />The Federal laws which contradict state & local laws must be abolished. The Federal Government needs to do the things it does best, or the states can not do (protect our country/borders, provide social security, provide health care, etc) and stop interfering with the states.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>American citizens are being taxed to death. Now with a slow economy, there is not enough money to do all the things the Federal Government has been set up to do. BUT, they should not be doing most of these things anyway.</div><br />	gmclam	4	12	8	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3658-4049	
3659-4049	Rebuttal Comment Periods	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Electronic rulemaking should encourage dialogue between the stakeholders. This often does not occur because of standard gamesmanship. Parties file their comments on the last day of the comment period and no interaction can occur.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The advantage of electronic rulemaking is that it opens up the process. But to truly benefit the agency the parties should have an opportunity to exchange their views one with the other. I may be being too optimistic here but not all rulemaking controversies are black and white matters for the stakeholders. Interchange between parties can minimize the contested issues and also develop a more detailed record.</div><br />	bbrandon	9	11	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3659-4049	
3660-4049	Paid "Classified" Sections on Government Websites	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Tag this idea as crazy. Or maybe not.<br /><br />Allow government websites to have appropriate paid classifieds for materially related goods and services. These classifieds would be organized like a yellow book where basic listings are free or affordable and larger adds cost more. <br /><br />Personally, I find it silly that government web sites are hesitant to link to non-government websites lest there is the appearance of endorsing a third party. <br /><br />Currently, the Federal Government--and the taxpayer--has poured trillions of dollars into the private sector to protect specific companies and private assets. Ostensibly, this is being done to help the entire economy. But there is no questions that certain companies, industries, and private citizens are benefiting.<br /><br />Moreover, the United States has auctioned spectrum and leased land to private parties for grazing, mining, and right of way. Our tax dollars go to build roads for main street business, and sometimes for roads that benefit only a few commercial interests. Government makes puts out bids and makes purchases from software to airplanes that makes (or breaks) whole companies. And I'm not even touching on government subsidies or earmarks.<br /><br />Considering all this, it is rather parochial to be concerned about government web site links to third parties web sites creating an unethical endorsement. Pshaw. The web itself is about linking. Moreover, it is many times easier (and costless) to rotate different links to make any particularly prime piece of web real-estate (or ordering) equitably available. Ordering could even be changed with each user coming to the page.<br /><br />Another way to make things equitable, not to mention revenue positive, is to charge for placement along the lines of classified ads. Each agency website could have a "directory" or "classified" section clearly labeled. Vendors listed on the site would be contractually required to not describe such listing as an endorsement.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a service for citizen. If I'm on the IRS site and I have a specific tax issue, why shouldn't the IRS point me in the direction of licensed, qualified individuals in my area? If I'm on CDC's site, why shouldn't I be able to find out vaccine locations? If I'm on Recovery.gov, why shouldn't I learn about other websites providing information about stimulus spending? <br /><br />Collaboration, especially on the web, is bi-directional. When the government spends trillions to support private financial interests, it is silly we preserve our ethics by avoiding web links.<br /><br />Greg Elin<br />http://twitter.com/gregelin<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Greg Elin	-3	4	7	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3660-4049

Of course the president does not make these choices alone, he makes them with his cabinet. But what about us? The American public should have an opportunity to influence the choices that the president makes. <br /> Each time the president has to make a decision on an issue he should put that issue on Whitehouse.gov with some background information relating to that issue. Then he should list different choices that he is considering for that specific issue and allow Americans to rate his choices. After rating each choice people should be given a space to explain why they chose their decisions. The President should take into consideration what the American public had to say and then make his decision. <br /> After making his decision the president should go back and address the people he disagreed with and make it clear to them why he chose they way he did.<br /> This would make the president more accountable for his actions and it would give the American public an opportunity to influence the White House. <br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea is important because we live in a country of 300 million people and it is all too easy for the voice of an individual to get lost when trying to influence the president.</div><br />	kevorkyan2006	4	11	7	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3661-4049

3664-4049	Prohibition didn't work in the 20th century ... and needs to END.	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The USA government should at the very least be embarassed by its attempt to prohibit certain activities and the use of so-called "controlled substances". Not only is the War on drugs a war they have lost, but it is one that the government can not win. It must end now.<br /><br />Legislators seem to have a mentality that just because they pass a law which bans something, that people will obey. Reality is often the opposite. Look back at the Prohibition of Alcohol and it seems obvious why that was later overturned. I just wonder why no one is smart enough to stop the stupid prohibition we have going on now.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The war on drugs is costly. Additionally, we incarcerate way too many otherwise law-abiding citizens just because they have possession of one of these controlled substances. Can you imagine how many drug pushers would be out of business overnight if the price of marijuana fell to mere pennies?<br /><br /><br /><br />ALL of these so-called controlled substances should not be treated any differently than we treat alcohol. Use them privately and intelligently, no problem. Get high and drive an auto, major consequences.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also consider the crime which is "drug related". This would, at the very least, DROP significantly. If these drugs are legal, and no longer so over-priced, at least people would not have to go to such extremes to come up with the cash necessary for their next fix.</div><br />	gmclam	70	76	6	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3664-4049

3667-4049	A National Approach to Public Engagement: Discovering Common Ground from Neighborhood to Nation	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Institute of the Commons (http://www.iotc-hub.org) <br />Submitted by co-directors, Kenoli Oleari and Marc Tognotti<br /><br />A National Approach to Public Engagement: Discovering Common Ground from Neighborhood to Nation<br /><br />We recommend a bold and far-reaching but simple and doable process for re-energizing citizenship across the country, connecting individuals and local vision, purpose and action to national and global vision, purpose and action. We imagine an inspiring project to unify our country and invigorate the concept of citizenship, a project with the inspiring symbolic power of Kennedy's proclaimed goal of landing a man on the moon. <br /><br />Institute a process to find and subsequently build on common ground at every level from our neighborhoods to the nation, as follows:<br /><br />(simplified)<br /><br />1. Start at the level of walking-distance neighborhoods to create networks of independent and autonomous neighborhood assemblies that agree to assemble the full diversity of perspectives in large numbers in order to: <br />a. let every view be heard to create a shared big picture in which everyone sees themselves acknowledged; do this with regard to: the past, the present, and dreams for the future, considering all levels: personal, the local community and the larger world;<br />b. engage the everyone together in exploring the whole before proposing action; <br />c. focus on discovering future goals and values supported by all - a shared vision for the neighborhood, the local town or city, and the larger world.<br />d. enable people to take individual responsibility for planning and committment to action;<br />To do this, use techniques drawn from large-group processes suited to the task (e.g. future search, open space technology, world café, whole-scale change, etc.).<br /><br />2. Building on the outcomes, repeat the pattern at succeeding levels: cities, regions, states, at each step sending (from each lower level to the next above) teams of delegates that remain in ongoing dialogue with and accountable to the lower levels and ultimately to the neighborhoods at the ground level. <br /><br />The outcomes include: <br /><br />Identification of shared goals that can be acted upon, because supported by all, and that can be subsequently deepened and developed at every level of our nation: individual, neighborhood, city, region, state and nation. We are looking to create an engine for the progressive development of agreement, collective intelligence and trust in our culture, for the progressive coordination of action in the service of shared goals, for the gradual re-empowerment of local community to serve as a source of innovation and economic prosperity and a check and balance to power at higher levels.<br /><br />A culture where there is true partnership between government and civil society, including appropriate division of labor between individual, community, public and private sectors, which also means a real rebirth and reinvigoration of the practice of Citizenship: again we will have individual citizens, groups and communities acting as citizens, citizens at every level and in every sector of individual and group identity. <br /><br />In this way, we can create an autonomous, ongoing neighborhood-based participatory democracy infrastructure, a fifth independent branch of our republic, that will provide a stronger foundation for our representative democracy -- something much like what Thomas Jefferson proposed in his idea for a "ward system," an idea that has been revived from time to time by notable Americans, including, recently, Senator Gary Hart in his book Restoration of the Republic. At the Institute of the Commons, we have outlined approaches (legislative and otherwise) capable of getting the ball rolling on this vision through public or private funding (http://www.iotc-hub.org)<br /><br />(Full Version)<br /><br />Institute of the Commons (www.iotc-hub.org)<br />A "Trust the Process" Implementation Proposal for a National approach to Public Engagement<br /><br /> We need a plan for how to implement a national public engagement program, an implementation plan for building a network of public engagement across the country. <br /><br />The most important thing we bring to the table is not our understanding of process, but our experience with process, i.e. what we know as a result of doing it. We have thousands of people around the world who have experience convening and implementing large groups of people using small and large teams of facilitators. There are a few highly visible examples of this, but there are many less visible examples which have built a huge community of skilled convenors. All of this energy can be brought into this project.<br /><br />Here is a view of how this might happen. It could be much improved if a large group got together using some of our process skills to put all of our experience to the task. This is meant to inspire and to give a sense that something like this could be done.<br /><br /> We hear a lot about the fact that bold steps are needed. Well, bold steps can't be taken unless we can envision them. By their nature bold steps are out of the box. If we propose something that is like what is already going on, we will never get anything different than what is already going on. Personally, I'd rather be bold and fall short than miss an opportunity and spend the rest of my life doing something I didn't want to do and which doesn't work anyway. Besides, anything we imagine immediately begins to exist in the universe in some energetic form. <br /><br />A bold imagining . . . and a practical suggestion to stimulate the imagination:<br /><br />1. This network and all public participation has to be process and participation focused, not issue focused. It is not about getting together experts and advocates on an issue but about bringing together the full range of citizens, including experts, advocates and officials, to work together to find a collaborative response to whatever issue is on the table.<br /><br />2. It needs to be a distributed network with the different nodes of that network, e.g. neighborhoods, communities, regions, states, associations, networks, any groupings of people interacting at higher and higher levels with each other. Some of this can parallel and interact with the distributed structure of contacts and operatives Obama created during his campaign. This is something he has already done! These groups don't need to be parallel or uniform. Because a high diversity of people will be assembled at every level, a self-organizing, coordinating and regulating process will evolve. More on this below.<br /><br />3. A "Trust the Process" Network Process: At the core of this will be a "network process" by which the whole country can be engaged from the neighborhood to the national level through a series of assemblies, starting at the lowest levels (neighborhood, community, region) and connection through higher and higher networks (region, state, national, global). Some of the expected benefits and outcomes might include:<br /><br /> • Build capacity for convening large groups of people whenever and wherever needed on any issue.<br /> • Inform decision makers on any issue being taken up across the country in real time (this actually feeds into local and state, as well as national government)<br /> • Work at the local level to build cohesive communities that can network with each other and feed into networks of communities; (this can serve other purposes, like emergency preparedness, response to the economic crisis, community mutual support for unemployed, failed mortgage holders, distributed energy development, schools, health care.)<br /> • Build more effective local state and regional government by supporting the capacities of constituencies to act on their own and interact effectively with governing entities.<br /> • Expose a larger and larger circle of people to this kind of public process and begin skill development to widen the field of experience. (Eventually these skills will become more endemic than Roberts Rules of Order.)<br /><br />4. The first network process: One way to kick this off is to put money into existing networks like NCDD, the future search network, the Open Space Network, the Center for Wise democracy, CII, the AI network, networks of local groups that provide mediation and facilitation services, the AS network, the IAF network, the ODN network, Institute of the Commons and more; (there are thousands, maybe 10s of thousands of such networks; I've only named a few I am connected with). This money will be used to start this process by modeling it in a test run which will be used to design and implement the network process itself. These groups will convene the first "Trust the Process" national network process by convening large groups (30 to thousands) of process people and other stakeholders (as always, full diversity) at each node to focus on how to build this national process network. These can be Open Space meetings, future search meetings, 20th Century town halls, Dynamic Facilitation, Whole Scale Change, A.I. processes, World Cafes, TOP stuff, any kind of effective large group engagement process that makes sense to those assembling, all feeding into each other. These can be hosted by networks of experienced process people and planned and convened by diversified planning teams of local stakeholders. This should be mobilized through the network process, NOT AS ONE BIG NATIONAL MEETING. It will follow the format of the network process, starting at the lowest level and networking between those nodes and upward, in this case, to the national level. The idea here is to: <br /><br /> • Include lots of experience process people (people who do public process, not heads of agencies who advocate for public process) along with other stakeholders <br /> • Hone and vitalize the network process framework<br /> • Provide a test run of the network process<br /> • Set up some basic guidelines for the network process (see 11, below)<br /> • Give people at every level, neighborhood, regional, state, national, experience with participative public process.<br /> • Begin to identify coordinating mechanisms for the process aspect of this project (don't over do this one)<br /> • Identify other potential process activities (like Wisdom Council, the British Columbia process, other) that might be taken up on a national (or other) level. (This should not dominate the process and might be a separate process.)<br /><br />5. Whenever a "network process" is implemented, each node or assembly needs to act on its own authority, not be subsidiary to any centralized authority. Coordination as needed can be implemented as needed starting at each node. Then networks of these assemblies can convene likewise, to focus on the next level, etc., until we have a national network capable of convening citizens at any and all levels from local neighborhoods to national or even larger levels. There will be less need to start with national assemblies, as people can be assembled quickly at even the neighborhood level to feed into networks feeding up to whatever level is desireable (e.g. region, state national or higher). With a fully mobilized network in the wings, this can happen quickly, even in a matter of weeks or months.<br /><br />6. Instead of setting any kind of central governance up for this process up front, any coordination functions can grow from this network as the need for coordination arises OUT OF THE ACTUAL ACTIONS of the network. It can arise and modify itself as needed.<br /><br />7. It probably makes sense to keep these assemblies small (say, less than 1000, or even 500, people), especially at the lower levels so that they start out with face-to-face interaction and provide enough diversity of nodes, and are rooted in local walking-distance neighborhoods where people can be in regular contact and share a common, embodied rather than virtual, daily experience. If they are too large to begin with, the input from local nodes will be blurred. As the network expands, it will be appropriate to assemble larger groups (in the multi-thousand range). It is my sense that the nodes need to meet on their own, not as a part of a larger process that includes nodes. There is too much dynamic here for making the nodes subsidiary to the larger process. It also takes longer and more resources to organize a large multi-node event. Nodes can organize by themselves and then join in networks of nodes. This parallel organizing will speed things up and diversify the input at the next level.<br /><br />8. On any issue, the network process can be mobilized. Whenever an issue comes along, a community, a local government, a state government, the Obama network, any entity wanting to engage the public or networks of these entities, can call on this network process as needed. It could be used for such purposes as an informing or authoring legislation, an environmental impact report, an economic development project, any project requiring public engagement, or any need requiring local and wider discovery and implementation of solutions. Many nodes will develop their own process and coordination over time to meet their own needs. Much planning at all levels may go on using sections of this network. How this will all be organized or coordinated can grow out of the network itself or sub-sections of the network.<br /><br />9. It is important not to let this get into the hands of hierarchically-oriented structures like universities, "national" NGOs, government agencies, advocacy groups. It is important not to over-direct it from the beginning. This has to be established right off the bat. It has to be a de-centralized network based in autonomous units, ultimately, possibly, rooted in networks of independent autonomous neighborhoods, coordinating through function and process, not governance or hierarchy.<br /><br />Of course this is the kind of thing that some national public process advocacy group will want to control because they know that is the only way it will be done right, some government agency will want to get funding to write rules for, some academic group will want to control because they are used to doing this, some business will want to turn into a commodity, or some consultants or others will want to get rich off of. Perhaps citizens will all want some authority to do it for them. <br /><br />Our biggest hedge here is getting lots of diverse people involved from all levels of society so they all have a stake in making it work. Once they get a taste, they will never want to go back. This will be much more effective than any control strategy.<br /><br />10. This can, in fact be a model for global organization.<br /><br />11. The regulating and coordinating dynamics, as alluded to above, will grow from highly diversified participation and be built on the needs that evolve from the actual action outcomes at each node and network level. There is some reason to provide, from the beginning, some guidelines that would be useful to support a true self-organizing dynamic at every level. This is something I think needs to be developed by a large group of people (diverse, as well, but including a strong component of people with LOTS of process experience.). The first iteration of this could be established in the initial network process described in 4, above. As an example of the kind of thing I am suggesting, I can offer some of what has worked for us in this regard:<br /><br /> • A full range of stakeholders (I know there are various means for achieving this and they should all be used as appropriate) including functional stakeholders (peoples roles and experience in society) and demographic stakeholders (race, gender, wealth, ability, etc.)<br /> • It would be useful to have some guides for determining this. As I have said elsewhere, the guides we use are: Those affected, those with the power or resources to hold things back or move them forward, people with the experience, knowledge, wisdom and skills needed. There are other methods, including random selection. With good planning at each node and network level, the appropriate method for doing this can be worked out. What is critical is that this is done in a way that does provide a way for a broad diversity of voices to participate.<br /> • A planning process that involves a microcosm of the whole from the very start.<br /> • Full inclusion. <br /> • Focus on discovering common ground, not resolving conflict.<br /> • All voices invited to uncompromisingly share their views, perspectives and feelings on the topic (understanding the whole by understanding the parts); create a shared picture of the whole in which all see themselves acknowledged<br /> • A way to support the convergence of these voices to discover where their common ground lies<br /> • Focus on action based on individuals making voluntary choices and public commitments (where people's energy shows up)<br /> • Process that follows the energy rather than directing the energy.<br /> • A planning process that involves a microcosm of the whole.<br /><br />12. One way to start building this list is to bring together a mini-network of process people (plus, as always, other stakeholders) to set up some initial parameters (a list like the one in 11, above) to set the whole thing in motion. Obama did something like this to suggest how to assemble house meetings. Part of the task of the first larger network process (see 4, above) will be to modify this list as needed and develop an ongoing set of guidelines for generating a self organizing network.<br /><br />13. There are going to have to be some cultural changes here in government. This won't work in a command and control environment. The actual functions of government don't have to change, but if members of government participate at every level, the outcomes of this participative network can be implemented organically through existing government structures. Oversight, control and regulation can continue in governmental realms. However, there are going to have to be some shifts in culture around this process itself. It is going to have to be built on a "trust the process" approach. The nodes and networks described will have to grow out of the process and results of that process at each stage. Controls on funding will have to be looser than in the typical government process, with power to utilize resources distributed through the network. This could possibly be achieved by instituting a grant program funded by government -- one possible route that we have developed at Institute of the Commons.<br /><br />14. If full diversity is attained in this process, there won't be any need to give it any kind of statutory power, as people with statutory power will be part of the process, and because statutory power is ultimately answerable to the ultimate authority: the people themselves, through this process articulate themselves into networks with the capacity to think and act collectively in pursuit of common goals. The idea is a culture of true partnership between community or civil society and government, rather than a relation of dependency. The many involved will partner with those having statutory power in building visions which can be implemented through a partnership between all parties, including government entitites. Implementation will come through commitment, relationship, shared vision, common ground and collaborative action rather than statutory authority.<br /><br />15. The academic community could serve a useful and important role observing, recording, providing historical context, disseminating information, etc., as well as sitting in the room with us and joining our conversations.<br /><br />16. We can recruit (or rather Obama can recruit) both public and private funding for this process. The suppliers of both of these kinds of funding are going to have to learn "trust the process." Obama will have to be the first to learn this.<br /><br />17. People need to be compensated for their work here. The network itself can contribute to an understanding of how to do this. Parameters can grow out of the process based on a shared understanding of what kinds of things need to be compensated.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It roots public engagement in the local neighborhood unit, building networks of neighborhoods spanning the entire nation.<br /><br />A National Approach to Public Engagement: Discovering Common Ground from Neighborhood to Nation<br /><br />We recommend a bold and far-reaching but simple and doable process for re-energizing citizenship across the country, connecting individuals and local vision, purpose and action to national and global vision, purpose and action.

Ideas to develop such a framework are in the initial stages at FEMA/DHS. <br /><br />This idea was developed by Federal managers at a conference on March 30-31, called Champions of Participation, which was convened by AmericaSpeaks, Demos, Everyday Democracy and Harvard University's Ash Institute.

3671-4049	Require data standardization for all postsecondary student data	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The Obama administration is trailblazing in health care by requiring an electronic health record. Higher education suffers from a lot of the same problems as health care yet most of the focus in education is centered around PK12.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Most of the focus in postsecondary education is centered around teaching and learning. I don't have a problem with that. But that doesn't mean the administrative data issues should be ignored. Policy makers focus on the policy and leave the implementation open ended. The result is very costly systems and an overall more difficult process for students. How can students begin to learn if the data on their transcripts and test scores can't be posted or loaded because of data quality issues? </div><br />	michael.sessa	10	11	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3671-4049	
3672-4049	Conferences for Collaboraiton (or End Traditional Conferences)	2009-05-27 00:00:00	This is for Collaboration across EVERYTHING...for Participation and for Capacity Building<br /><br />Between Federal Agencies <br />Between Federal, State, and Local Governments <br />Public-Private Partnerships <br />Do-It-Yourself Government <br /><br />----------------<br />Making innovative change in big systems is challenging. I know, I have been working hard on a particularly large challenge myself - supporting the emergence of the identity layer of the web. One of the biggest reasons for our success has been to meet face to face every 6 months but not using "traditional" conference formats - instead we meet using participant driven processes (80-90% of the time is spend using open space technology). I want to share the story of it and then talk about how the ideas can be applied to open government. <br /><br />Traditional Gathering - They are boring and the WEB CHANGES EVERYTHING<br />One way people think about getting change to happen is bringing people together for conferences and meetings. This is an important part. HOWEVER most meetings and conferences that use traditional the traditional format of one-to-many speaking to a theater style audience WASTE time and effort and don't actually get closer to collaboration, don't build community and don't make constructive change. The web changes everything - just get people to watch <br /><br /><br />Changing Big Systems with Innovative Gatherings<br />When I began 5 years ago it was a small group of people with big ideas about what was possible if people had the ability to move across the web with their own identity. We met at other people's conferences in side meetings for a year and then in the fall of 2005 we decided to have our own "big" conference of 85 people. The first day we heard presentations from 8 different projects working on being part of making an identity (for people) layer of the web happen. The second day we used the open space technology method to support the community gathered meeting and talking about the overall goal and moving projects forward. <br /><br />One conversation that was had was about how URL based user-centric protocols could just work together instead of being separate. This it turned out was first conversation of what would become OpenID version 2. (http://www.openid.net) <br /><br />The community continued to meet every 6 months at the Internet Identity Workshop (http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com) we just had our 8th one it is attended by the most senior architects and decision makers working at all the major technology companies. This includes Microsoft, MySpace, Facebook, AOL, Yahoo!, Plaxo, Google, CA, Novell, BT, Oracle, SUN, Cisco, etc. <br /><br />We are making a lot of progress and open standards are being innovated and adopted by the community. Their are several reasons we make so much progress:<br /><br />*The agenda for our meetings is not set ahead of time - it is created live the day the event happens. All who care and have a passion for what we are working can come and participate - putting their ideas forward. <br /><br />* New pressing/emerging issues can be discussed at length. <br /><br />* There is a real community between people who have each other - a deep respect for their work and them as people. This culture both comes for some having known each other for years now AND is not an "old-boys/girls" network that is unwelcoming to new peole - because the agenda is open to all - it creates a welcoming forum for new people and new ideas. <br /><br />* The face to face meeting time is leveraged by existing projects that have mailing lists to get work done. Rather then having "real" meetings around the edges of "pre-programmed" talking heads. <br /><br /><br />Relevance to Governenace <br />What do technical things on the internet have to do with governance and society? You can look at with a sort of "code is law" perspective that is the protocols and the code that uses the protocol defines what is possible - the "laws" by which these systems operate. <br /><br />There are MANY diverse interested (conflicting commercial and ego) interests at play working in this field. This is the same as any political governance space. Over time we have seen a marked reduction in the tensions and acramony and really profound collaborations emerge. <br /><br />Change the Format Change Everything<br />"Traditional" conferences and trade shows that government agencies host and that government employees attend should be strongly encouraged to adopt open space technology and other interactive formats. Ending events where 95% of all the boring from the front presentations that are one-many. Where the real value of face time is used for dialogue and discussion between people. People got to meetings with "pre-planned" talking heads agenda's because their "boss will approve" this culture needs to end and supporting events where real and deep dialogue occurs amongst knowledgeable professionals and with citizens needs to become a priority. <br /><br />What is prestigious?<br />Government Workers with "important titles" should see participating in a collaborative forum as more valuable and more prestigious then "giving a talk" to a conference audience and then running off to the next meeting or talk. I have seen this happen and little value comes from it except a resume/or record check box is filled. <br /><br />If agencies and others need people to "see" presentations - have them sent ahead as YouTube Video's or as PDF documents. People time should be used for what is most rare and valuable in this time of shrinking budgets for travel and limited time - DIALOGUE. The wisdom in the room should be tapped through dialogue not "spoken at". <br /><br />Facilitation and Documentation.<br />Skilled facilitation and design is needed to make these events very successful. There is a whole network and community of facilitators who use both open space and other methods to support professional communities coming together over time and being very effective. The results of these interactive conference formats need to be documented - this is a place where innovation can occur. Most often right now it is done with volunteers amongst participants talking notes. Resources can be put into having paid note takers along with having photo, video and other electronic forms of documentation to support the meetings. <br /><br />I do design and Facilitation of "unconferences" for professional communities regularly.<br />I blog on this as well - http://www.unconference.net<br />Kaliya Hamlin<br />kaliya (at) Mac (dot) com<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>If you change the default form of meeting you will change a lot quite quickly. Cultures will change. The level of collaboration, understanding and community will grow and so with this being able to solve difficult problems. It is a simple yet profound way to make a huge difference - use the face time that those in our service have at conferences for real dialogue. </div><br />	kaliya	10	12	2	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3672-4049	
3673-4049	Reduce Legislative Staff	2009-05-27 00:00:00	We elect officials to represent us. We pay them a pretty good salary, plus an expense acount. They are paid for travel and have their own heath care and retirement plans. If that is not enough, they also have multiple offices and hire lots of staff.<br /><br />In other words, just having all of these elected officials cost each and every one of us a pretty penny. When the economy slows, they always scare us with laying off police & fire fighters, closing libraries, schools & parks. There is something VERY wrong with that picture.<br /><br />When there is not enough tax money coming in, the first thing that should go is legislative staff, offices and/or budgets. The last thing to go should be education and public safety.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Legislators are the actual people who write and approve government's budgets. If they are not smart enough (or lack greed), then it is THEIR OWN PERSONAL situations which should be affected first, not the people they represent.

3674-4049	Take dialogs like this one to the next level: Open, Public, Integrated and under a Stakeholder Participatory Architecture	2009-05-27 00:00:00	This Open Government Dialogue is a great step toward realizing the promise of the new Administration toward participatory, transparent and accountable government - and the next step is to close the gap between the current efforts and what would be required to use this and other online tools for full, formal and effective engagement and decision making between Americans and our representatives. This means, among other things:<br />1. Address the need for effective management of citizen identity, authentication and privacy in the user account system enabling these types of online dialogs and other online government interactions. Without a secure and reliable way of effectuating identity management, civic engagement is easily defeated by fraud artists, hackers and political dirty tricksters. Using an IP address alone or an e-mail address is, obviously, not effective identity management. However, systems like Real ID (a national identity system) or other government run citizen identity schemes have their own technical, political and business perils and are not appropriate. A commission or other task force at a high level is needed to explore and suggest options for identity.<br />2. Open up the "In" and "Out" points in an interoperable architecture such that any individual or organization can easily post data to their own system and using tools like RSS, Atom or other web services solutions, allow that data to be contributed to the national, public information systems that enable open government. In this way, the energy and momentum of every citizen and American organization can be easily harnessed without requiring them to go to the government website in order to play. This requires a thoughtful and stakeholder agreeable architecture. <br />3. Do more online dialogue. <br /><br />For more information on these and related approaches to open government, please see:<br /><br />www.civics.com (my site)<br />www.opendialogcoaltion.org (supporting an Open Public Integrated Architecture)<br /><br />Thanks,<br /> - Dazza Greenwood<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	daz.greenwood	14	16	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3674-4049	
3675-4049	Allowing People to Control Their Own Words	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Rather than try to centralize conversations on web sites such as this, allow people to publish in their own way. You can promote lightweight standards that people could add to their own content on their own sites/blogs/Twitter pages, that would allow the government and others to aggregate them for moderation and analysis. This would free government from having to waste time moderate what is said, have arbitrary voting methods that doesn't allow for alternative ones. <br /><br />So in the spirit of that I will point you to the idea of the Open Public Integrated Architecture:<br /><br />http://advocatehope.org/hopes/the-open-dialog-coalitions-open-public-integrated-architecture<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Because centralizing conversations is counter to the spirit and architecture of the World Wide Web.</div><br />	Daniel Bennett	-1	5	6	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3675-4049

First step is to change failing banks into government run banks, same employees (not management) and offer the people of America 14% interest on their savings so that we can have capital without relying on the greed of the corrupt wealthy. Second step is to offer loans at 5% interest so that we can make more money saving than we can borrowing, but the incentive to borrow is strong so that growth can occur. Third is to get HR 676 passed so that we are no longer buying crap instead of healthcare. Fourth is to standardized our public education systems across the country so that we can still communicate and avoid the tearing apart of our commonwealth by folks who believe and invest in a new world order. Forth, give the job of parenting back to the parents, and reserve the role of the press and the police for real criminals and terrorists, including those who promote hate radio. Fifth, get the Fairness Doctrine back in our rule of law so all parties can have an equal point of view and our people are no longer propagandized "1984" style but the wealthy folks point of view that really wants to cause civil war so Halliburton can rebuild America. We are not that stupid. That is why we need to review http://www.noodlebrain.com that retrains people rendered stupid by the current economy to think outside of the box.

3681-4049	Access (to data) Replaces Reporting Processes	2009-05-27 00:00:00	To make tranparency a reality, an important policy would be to ask all government agencies to try to significantly reduce the number of prepared reports that are sent up and down the formal communication channels within an agency. Instead, we should move towards providing those who need it, direct access to the data. If we do this in an intelligent way, we could have automated templates which build the reports automatically. <br /><br />Within the Defense Acquisition Process for instance, this would save tons of dollars and time. Each different document required for meeting a milestone is comprised of various information elements, like a program's risk posture, or their acquisition strategy. These information elements are continually "recreated" by different people each time a different document requires them. From the acquisition program's standpoint, they are spending tons more money recreating the same information slightly differently, which leads to oversight personnel then challenging the program based on the differences in the documents. Considering Congress basically asks for the same information multiple times in multiple formats, a good chunk of the time involves simply managing the reporting process. If the program managed the information elements instead, and the reports were automatically created, significant savings would arise.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Access Replacing Reporting will cause Agencies to work harder to make their information accessible, because they will end up getting significant cost savings. Additional benefits involve a higher degree of trust, as everyone will be working off the same data. </div><br />	ndickover	14	14	0	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3681-4049

3683-4049	A NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINABILITY ADDRESSES ALL CATEGORIES FOR IMPROVING GOVERNMENT	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The Citizens Network for Sustainable Development has been urging our federal government to fulfill it's commitment to develop and implement a National Strategy for Sustainability for more than ten years now. I posted an idea and proposal on this idea yesterday (May 27) under the category of New Strategies and Techniques of Participation. It has already gotten quite a few votes and will probably receive substantially more than this posting. See: http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3299-4049. A National Strategy will not focus on just one or two components or criteria for better and more open government, but instead on most aspects of this challenge. I am thus including a description below of how a National Strategy for Sustainability could be used to address most of the categories that are listed in the Open Government Dialogue. <br /><br />The Citizens Network for Sustainable Development is urging the Obama Administration and Congress to lead our country and people in Developing and Implementing a National Strategy for Sustainability, as agreed to by all of the UN Member States during both the Rio Earth Summit Conference in 1992 and the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. Indeed all countries agreed to "begin to implement their National Strategy Plans by 2005", so we are already several years behind in fulfilling this important commitment. <br /><br />President Obama has repeatedly stated that his Administration will be both a good global citizen and will contribute substantially to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Developing and implementing a National Strategy for Sustainability is needed to fulfill Millennium Development Goal #7 which calls for "ensuring environmental sustainability" and "integrating the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programs and reversing the loss of environmental resources."<br /><br />TRANSPARENCY <br /><br />One of the primary objectives, goals, and components of a National Strategy for Sustainability should be to provide more transparency within government at all levels. Mechanisms should be developed as a part of the implementation process to make data more accessible, make government operations more visible, and to provide open access to key information such as is applicable to the primary indicators that are used to measure and assess progress that is being made to implement the sustainability plan. <br /><br />PARTICIPATION<br /><br />The work of existing and new Federal Advisory Committees should be integrated into both the development and implementation of the National Strategy for Sustainability. In fact some type of an independent National Council on Sustainable Development should be created, with a mandate and structure similar to that of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Public Administration, which will act as a Federal Advisory Committee for most purposes. <br /><br />Many of the recommendations that come from the National Strategy Process could be instituted either as Executive Orders or as federal, state, and local rules, regulations, or legislation. In fact one of the primary goals of the process would be to evaluate existing rules, regulations, and legislation to determine whether they are sufficient for achieving set and agreed upon goals and then to take sufficient action to ensure that they are sufficient for achieving the goals. <br /><br />COLLABORATION<br /><br />Collaboration within, between and among various levels of government should be one of the primary focuses of the National Strategy. Indeed regional coordinating bodies and councils are needed at various levels of government to ensure that adequate processes are in place for efficient coordination, collaboration, and implementation. The President's Council on Sustainable Development included many recommendations for such coordinating bodies and councils which ought to be acted upon, including a Joint Center on Sustainable Communities. I am including a summary of many of the primary recommendations from the President's Council below. See: http://clinton5.nara.gov/PCSD <br /><br />In addition, one of the key contributions that the development of a National Strategy could make would be to encourage and support the development of citizen initiatives and public-private partnerships. Indeed the focus on Sustainable Development, both in the US and around the world, has seen a growing interest and dedication to public-private partnerships which are particularly apparent in the recent development of UN Partnership Initiatives - of which both the Bush and Obama Administrations have championed and paid a great deal of interest. Indeed the National Strategy could serve as a primary means for raising awareness in the US, among stakeholders, government entities, and the public, about the work and efforts of these UN Partnerships and how the US can participate and take advantage more so in and of their development. <br /><br />CAPACITY BUILDING<br /><br />Another primary emphasis of the National Strategy should be to encourage and support Capacity Building and Development. At both the local level and within industries, municipalities and businesses have provided and undergone a great deal of training and staff development as they have developed their own sustainability plans. However, this is still far from universal and similar activities could now be more fruitfully developed as well at the state and federal levels. Development and implementation of a National Strategy could thus serve to foster and support the further development of such training and development programs. <br /><br />In addition, there is a growing interest within the academic community in integrating Education for Sustainable Development throughout the curriculum - as mandated in the Outcome Document of the World Summit on Sustainable Development and the UN Decade on Education for Sustainable Development. The extent to which the U.S. Department of Education; federal, state, and local governments; and our educational institutions support and promote efforts to educate and train professors, teachers, and students about the basic principles, attributes, and components of sustainable development is also the extent to which our country will be prepared for the social, economic, and environmental challenges and requirements that are likely to confront us, and that we must deal with, in the 21st century. <br /><br />Going beyond this, one of the key lessons that was learned from the President's Council on Sustainable Development is the imperative need to publicize and promote the efforts to develop and implement the National Strategy for Sustainability in as broad and energetic a way as possible. One reason that more of the recommendations from the President's Council were not implemented was that the process was not sufficiently promoted, especially in the earlier years. <br /><br />Indeed all Americans must be made aware of the planning and implementation efforts and encouraged and welcomed to participate fully in the process. Indeed one of the primary components of the National Strategy should be to focus on communication strategies and an open and participatory process should be developed to enroll and involve as many people, stakeholders, and professionals in the communication process as possible. Just imagine the great suggestions and contributions that might come from the business community, students, and educators to enhance and promote the communication processes. <br /><br />Indeed some great work is already being done by students, alternative and mass media, in local communities, and by professional organizations in order to promote the need and raise awareness about sustainable development - of which I could provide many excellent examples - including the Earth Team (http://www.earthteam.net); Guerrilla in the Greenhouse (http://www.greengorilla.com); Captain Planet Foundation (http://captainplanetfdn.org); NBC's Green Is Universal; Free Range Studios; GoodWorks Public Relations (http://www.goodworkspr.com); and Sustainable Today (http://SustainableToday.org); etc. <br /><br />Finally, one of the primary components of the National Strategy should focus on Strategic Planning and Budgeting. In fact the development and implementation of the Strategy Plan could provide an excellent means of engaging the concerned public in planning and budgetary processes and indeed has often resulted in such interest at the local and state levels to date.

3684-4049	Allow everybody to talk to participate meaningfully in civic online infrastructures and open public architectures	2009-05-27 00:00:00	To create a new dynamic, decentralized dialog system that will involve adapting simple and lightweight architecture organically derived from commonly used web standards. Instead of the inclination of organizations to control the conversation and centralize the publishing, moderation and analysis of dialogues, we want to help allow people to use the tools that best suit them for publishing, allow for aggregation tools to provide multiple moderation systems and allow for competitive analysis. This idea is born of using the natural architecture of the Internet to allow for more open discussions with more opportunities for synthesizing ideas.<br /><br />Open Public Integrated Architecture is a method for achieving this type of web 2.0 based model of citizen and stakeholder interaction. More information about this concept is available at www.opendialogcoalition.org<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This is important because the process of self-governance by free people must not depend solely upon the good will and benign restraint of the government to wisely and fairly moderate online dialog and interaction. Rather, the ability to distribute processes, information flows and services should be arranged and architected to enable the people at large to see, participate in and help to manage the systems enabling their self-government and representative government. This has not been technically possible in the past due to constraints of time and space, but the Internet and semantic and service-oriented web technologies make this dream of the founders a real possibility. To achieve it, a unified and tailored set of legal, business and technology frameworks must be developed, tested, refined and rolled out and those services and components will comprise - in effect - the public works and civic infrastructures of the online government of tomorrow. </div><br />	daz.greenwood	10	14	4	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3684-4049	
3685-4049	Turn to colleges and universities, fund curricular, co-curricular, and community-based innovation 	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Higher education can play a pivotal role in this open government initiative. Here are a few things that colleges and universities can do and that the government can support:<br />-teach democracy, not just basic civics: All (not just a few in specific majors or programs) students should graduate from college understanding and valuing Constitutional principles of freedom, justice, equity, representation, and active citizenry<br />-teach civic skills: intercultural dialogue, critical analysis, civil discourse and deliberation, community coalition building and problem solving, leadership, ethical decision making<br />-inform: serve as open sources of accurate, balanced information on current events and pressing social and political problems, not only for students but for the general public<br />-support public scholarship, research issues for the public good<br />-convene: convene forums so that members of the campus community and the broader community can study, discuss, and work together to solve public problems<br />-facilitate interdisciplinary learning and problem solving: real problems call for interdisciplinary solutions<br />-teach teachers and partner with schools to make this a pre-K - life agenda<br />-provide continuing education in democracy's principles and practices<br />-make postsecondary education affordable and accessible<br /><br />I suggest changing the title here from training and development to education and development.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Our educational systems were put in place to help facilitate a strong democracy. This is a critical partnership that shouldn't be overlooked.</div><br />	nancy.thomas	21	24	3	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3685-4049	
3686-4049	Opening Up Government Operations through a National Strategy for Sustainability	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The Citizens Network for Sustainable Development has been urging our federal government to fulfill it's commitment to develop and implement a National Strategy for Sustainability for more than ten years now. I posted an idea and proposal on this idea yesterday (May 27) under the category of New Strategies and Techniques of Participation. It has already gotten quite a few votes and will probably receive substantially more than this posting. See: http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3299-4049. A National Strategy will not focus on just one or two components or criteria for better and more open government, but instead on most aspects of this challenge. I am thus including a description below of how a National Strategy for Sustainability could be used to address most of the categories that are listed in the Open Government Dialogue. <br /><br />The Citizens Network for Sustainable Development is urging the Obama Administration and Congress to lead our country and people in Developing and Implementing a National Strategy for Sustainability, as agreed to by all of the UN Member States during both the Rio Earth Summit Conference in 1992 and the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. Indeed all countries agreed to "begin to implement their National Strategy Plans by 2005", so we are already several years behind in fulfilling this important commitment. <br /><br />President Obama has repeatedly stated that his Administration will be both a good global citizen and will contribute substantially to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Developing and implementing a National Strategy for Sustainability is needed to fulfill Millennium Development Goal #7 which calls for "ensuring environmental sustainability" and "integrating the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programs and reversing the loss of environmental resources."<br /><br />TRANSPARENCY <br /><br />One of the primary objectives, goals, and components of a National Strategy for Sustainability should be to provide more transparency within government at all levels. Mechanisms should be developed as a part of the implementation process to make data more accessible, make government operations more visible, and to provide open access to key information such as is applicable to the primary indicators that are used to measure and assess progress that is being made to implement the sustainability plan. <br /><br />PARTICIPATION<br /><br />The work of existing and new Federal Advisory Committees should be integrated into both the development and implementation of the National Strategy for Sustainability. In fact some type of an independent National Council on Sustainable Development should be created, with a mandate and structure similar to that of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Public Administration, which will act as a Federal Advisory Committee for most purposes. <br /><br />Many of the recommendations that come from the National Strategy Process could be instituted either as Executive Orders or as federal, state, and local rules, regulations, or legislation. In fact one of the primary goals of the process would be to evaluate existing rules, regulations, and legislation to determine whether they are sufficient for achieving set and agreed upon goals and then to take sufficient action to ensure that they are sufficient for achieving the goals. <br /><br />COLLABORATION<br /><br />Collaboration within, between and among various levels of government should be one of the primary focuses of the National Strategy. Indeed regional coordinating bodies and councils are needed at various levels of government to ensure that adequate processes are in place for efficient coordination, collaboration, and implementation. The President's Council on Sustainable Development included many recommendations for such coordinating bodies and councils which ought to be acted upon, including a Joint Center on Sustainable Communities. I am including a summary of many of the primary recommendations from the President's Council below. See: http://clinton5.nara.gov/PCSD <br /><br />In addition, one of the key contributions that the development of a National Strategy could make would be to encourage and support the development of citizen initiatives and public-private partnerships. Indeed the focus on Sustainable Development, both in the US and around the world, has seen a growing interest and dedication to public-private partnerships which are particularly apparent in the recent development of UN Partnership Initiatives - of which both the Bush and Obama Administrations have championed and paid a great deal of interest. Indeed the National Strategy could serve as a primary means for raising awareness in the US, among stakeholders, government entities, and the public, about the work and efforts of these UN Partnerships and how the US can participate and take advantage more so in and of their development. <br /><br />CAPACITY BUILDING<br /><br />Another primary emphasis of the National Strategy should be to encourage and support Capacity Building and Development. At both the local level and within industries, municipalities and businesses have provided and undergone a great deal of training and staff development as they have developed their own sustainability plans. However, this is still far from universal and similar activities could now be more fruitfully developed as well at the state and federal levels. Development and implementation of a National Strategy could thus serve to foster and support the further development of such training and development programs. <br /><br />In addition, there is a growing interest within the academic community in integrating Education for Sustainable Development throughout the curriculum - as mandated in the Outcome Document of the World Summit on Sustainable Development and the UN Decade on Education for Sustainable Development. The extent to which the U.S. Department of Education; federal, state, and local governments; and our educational institutions support and promote efforts to educate and train professors, teachers, and students about the basic principles, attributes, and components of sustainable development is also the extent to which our country will be prepared for the social, economic, and environmental challenges and requirements that are likely to confront us, and that we must deal with, in the 21st century. <br /><br />Going beyond this, one of the key lessons that was learned from the President's Council on Sustainable Development is the imperative need to publicize and promote the efforts to develop and implement the National Strategy for Sustainability in as broad and energetic a way as possible. One reason that more of the recommendations from the President's Council were not implemented was that the process was not sufficiently promoted, especially in the earlier years. <br /><br />Indeed all Americans must be made aware of the planning and implementation efforts and encouraged and welcomed to participate fully in the process. Indeed one of the primary components of the National Strategy should be to focus on communication strategies and an open and participatory process should be developed to enroll and involve as many people, stakeholders, and professionals in the communication process as possible. Just imagine the great suggestions and contributions that might come from the business community, students, and educators to enhance and promote the communication processes. <br /><br />Indeed some great work is already being done by students, alternative and mass media, in local communities, and by professional organizations in order to promote the need and raise awareness about sustainable development - of which I could provide many excellent examples - including the Earth Team (http://www.earthteam.net); Guerrilla in the Greenhouse (http://www.greengorilla.com); Captain Planet Foundation (http://captainplanetfdn.org); NBC's Green Is Universal; Free Range Studios; GoodWorks Public Relations (http://www.goodworkspr.com); and Sustainable Today (http://SustainableToday.org); etc. <br /><br />Finally, one of the primary components of the National Strategy should focus on Strategic Planning and Budgeting. In fact the development and implementation of the Strategy Plan could provide an excellent means of engaging the concerned public in planning and budgetary processes and indeed has often resulted in such interest at the local and state levels to date. In addition, sustainability indicators, Genuine Progress Indicators, and other assessment tools have often done a much better job of analyzing real world impacts than have more strictly defined economic indicators and also of including crucially important externalities in decision-making processes. <br /><br />As you can see the development and implementation of a National Strategy for Sustainability could serve as a key vehicle and strategy for improving the operations, transparency, participation, and collaboration in government and at all levels. <br /><br /><br />===============================================<br /><br />Suggested Components and Activities for a<br />National Strategy for Sustainability<br /><br />Prepared by Rob Wheeler<br />Citizens Network for Sustainable Development<br /><br /><br />The proposed components included below were drawn primarily from the work of the President's Council on Sustainable Development which met and solicited input from the American public in the 1990s.

This can help to identify more ideas, and increase public support of good ideas. Providing the resources for local organizers to do this, and a channel through which they can report the outcomes would ensure that participants feel their voices have been heard.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"Draw on best practices from other countries to help inform public engagement, especially as it pertains to the green economy"<br /><br />Many other countries, especially in Europe, are today far more advanced in greening their economies. The administration can learn from their successes and failures by including their stories for public engagement discussions and community outreach domestically. While contextual differences should be taken into account, these examples might help to better inform the U.S. public on what is possible.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"Simplify public procurement processes to promote collaboration with the administration in organizing people locally"<br /><br />Local community organizers, facilitators and others in the civil society sector have been working to make many of the changes that the administration is now also seeking to make. These change makers should be able to collaborate with the administration. While the administration seeks greater collaboration and transparency, it is unfortunately also bound my numerous regulations in terms of public procurement processes. A separate channel should be found so that public services provided by actors outside the public sector are not happening in parallel, but rather in dialogue with administration staff. Moreover, the administration will have a difficult time mobilizing mass participation of those folks who will not be engaged through online tools. Local organizers can help to ensure that mass participation and public engagement is also representative of Americans who might not respond to all the web-based tools that the administration develops. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />â&euro;&#x17E;Develop A International Lessons Learned Programme of Citizens Participationâ&euro;&oelig;<br /><br />A systematic look at experiences and models in different countries and cultures could lead to fruitful impulses and innovations for the US.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Meister Consultants Group, Boston	1	5	4	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3689-4049

There was a lot of talk about a possible active role for him at the State Department before Hillary was selected, to mix in engagement, intimidation and rational relationships that can help improve US international relations in lasting policy rather that through reaction to world events and ending the stalemate in foreign policy debates in preventing emerging threats before they occur, as well as improve international law to go beyond the Guantanamo debate.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Chuck Hagel's view of progressive Nixonian policies of engagement are needed especially now with various new sources of instability emerging.</div><br />	jornatowski	-2	4	6	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3690-4049	
3691-4049	A Model for Partnerning Citizens, Experts and Policy Makers	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Policy makers who seek public input should understand the nature and limits of the information they seek. Do they want to know about community values? Or do they want to know some technical data about their options? Are they trying to give rational structure to their poloicy problem? Or, are they trying to evaluate alternative policies under consideration?<br /><br />Involving the general public in complex public policy issues works best when, as a matter of empirical fact based on our experience in Oregon, policy makers, the public, and technical experts engage with one another as partners in a common endeavor. All three are members of the same community, but they have different roles to play in serving the common good. The general public articulates community values. Experts identify relevant facts and probabilities. Policy makers combine community values and the best available data in choosing among various alternatives.<br /><br />Specifically, citizen participation contributes to the realization of three important goals: First, the normative rationale of deliberation gives meaning to democracy in policy formation and implementation. Second, value input from a broad range of the public can get decision makers to think ouside the box and enhance the quality of the decision process; and third, participation plays an important educational and psychological role in the social development of the individual citizen. <br /><br />The "Public Policy Partnership (PPP) Model" proposed here can be combined with various group process techniques such as focus groups, town hall meeetings, or community meetings. These various approaches yield qualitative data to aid the policy maker's intuitive understanding of the values information relevant to the issue at hand. The model can also be combined with quantitative survey methods to assess the distribution and intensity of values held by members of a given community.<br /><br />On the public side of the discourse, the process begins with the policy maker's desire to understand the community values relevant to the particular policy issue at stake. The key to this discourse mode is the question, "What is important to you about X?" followed by "Why?" asked recursively to move from superficial preferences to more stable core values.<br /><br />Properly designed community meetings can generae public input that flows from questions that encourage wise discussion among a broad cross section of the public. For example, in the realm of science and technology, how private should genetic information be? Should it be exclusively under the control of the individual? The family? Humanity? Pharmaceutical companies? Who should have access to information about a person's genetic makeup? Private individuals or families? The State? These are not factual matters to be decided by experts, but rather matters related to the values held by the community.<br /><br />Expert information, on the other hand, is evidence-based data about issues. Technical discourse relies on established norms for determining the most plausible evidence. Here the policy maker needs to hear and understand the strength of the evidence that a given explanation of an issue is the best one available. It is a common practice for the policy maker to commission technical reports from appropriate expert consultants. A difficult and critically important task of the policy maker is to guide the technical experts to focus on those specific aspects of their field of expertise relevant to the issue at hand. <br /><br />In this model, the policy maker is a "receptor site." The policy decision maker--a committee, commission, legislature, board of directors, or negotiation team--must be committed to combine the public's input about values with expert information about facts into a coherent policy. A well-prepared receptor site will optimize this outcome by a) involving the decision makers in the design of the information-gathering proces, and b) coming to agreement with them on how they can best bring the information obtained to bear in deciding among policy alternatives. <br /><br />The PPP model proposed here replaces the usual three-step approach of 1)consulting with experts, 2) selecting among various policy options provided by those experts, and then 3) inviting public comment on a near final draft of a policy statment with a public participation process structured to partner citizens experts, and policly makers in a coordinated process that can broaly formulate the decision problem, guide analysis to improve participants' understanding of decisions, seek the meaning of analytic findings and uncertainties, and improve the ability of interested and affected parties to participate effectively in the risk decision process.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Using the Public Policy Partnership Model of public participation, policy decisions will benefit by improving a) the appropriate impact of expert input; b) the appropriate inpact of public input, and c) the process by which expert input, publc input, and decision-maker perspectives are combined to yield a choice among policy alternatives in the common good. Too often the pluralism of our society is seen as an obstable to creating a viable ethical and political consensus on policy issues of various stripes. The model proposed here is to make that pluralism a source of enlightenment rather than confusion, an enabling rather than a disabling feature of our democratic way of life. </div><br />	gfowler	18	19	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3691-4049	
3694-4049	Establish Stakeholder Perspectives	2009-05-27 00:00:00	I'm using this approach in the city of Portland and have used it with geographically dispersed and local organizations (communities). <br /><br />The first step is to build the stakeholder matrix by identifying the stakeholder groups, and their interests. Measurements are developed that support the interests. By considering all the major stakeholder groups a balance set of measurements can be established. It is very important that the interests be quantified where possible. One way to do this is ask the stakeholder what a perfect program would look like. <br /><br />Often stakeholders are ignorant of other stakeholders and their interests. <br /><br />The stakeholder matrix is also useful in inviting representatives to a conversations where the different perspectives are focused on a specific problem or question. I've used a World Cafe format with a graphic recorder and a narrative that captures the outcome. <br /><br />Here's an example of an output from a community Healthcare conversation. <br />http://www.cityclubofcentraloregon.com/City_Club_Forums/Vision_for_Healthcare_Cafe_Summary/default.aspx<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It defines program stakeholders and estabishes measurable outcomes It provides a mechanism to bring the different interests together to have a meaningful conversation with a shared visual and story. </div><br />	john	9	12	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3694-4049	
3695-4049	Taking-back-the-sovereign-power-to-create-money-to-address-Peak-Oil	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The Constitution states, "Congress shall have the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof." This power has been abdicated to private bankers. Today, 99.99% of our money is created by private banks when they make loans. This includes the Federal Reserve, a private banking corporation, which orders Federal Reserve Notes to be printed, and then lends them to the U.S. government. Only coins are actually created by the government itself. Coins compose only about 1-10,000th of the M3 money supply, and Federal Reserve Notes compose about 3% of it. All of the rest is created by banks as loans, something they do by simply writing numbers into accounts.<br /><br />Congress could take back the power to create the national money supply by:<br />(a) Nationalizing the Federal Reserve.<br />(b) Reviving the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a government-owned lending facility used by Roosevelt to fund the New Deal. Rather than merely recycling borrowed money as Roosevelt did, however, the RFC could actually create credit on its books, in the same way that banks do it today, by fanning its capital base into many times that sum in loans. Assuming $300 billion is left of the TARP money approved by Congress last fall, this money could be deposited into the RFC and leveraged into $3 trillion in loans. That's based on a 10% reserve requirement. If the money were counted as capital, at an 8% capital requirement it could be leveraged into 12.5 times the original sum. That would be enough to fund not only President Obama's stimulus package but many other programs that are desperately short of funding now.<br /><br />The United States should recreate the United States Postal Savings Bank. This will allow many people to invest in the United States, as new immigrants did when the Postal Savings Bank was created in 1910. This will allow the national government to issue low-interest loans to students, small businesses, and farmers whose interest will obviate the need for substantial taxes and interest on government debt.<br /><br />The Bank of North Dakota keeps North Dakota prosperous. A true national people's bank will save the United States from the same usurious ruin that befell Rome, France, and forestall the hyperinflation that consumed Weimar Germany. Greenbakcs saved the Union under President Lincoln. Greenbacks will save the nation again -- from the same moneylending enemies who threatened ruin to Pres. Lincoln.<br /><br />Many references are available which will be furnished on request. See generally www.webofdebt.com/articles and Ellen H. Brown, "The Web of Debt".<br /><br />See also Michael C.

3701-4049	uncategorized	2009-05-27 00:00:00	This is a terrific idea and a great start. Thanks for doing this, and thanks for caring enough to take this innovative step.<br /><br />When I facilitate a dialogue, I do what you've done, which is brainstorm and solicit a lot of ideas. Then there is the process of closing by combining like-minded ideas, eliminating duplicates, playing with language, and tidying up the list. I think that might have helped in this process. Perhaps the brainstorm should have two steps -- the opening and the sythesizing. This would be before your next phase.<br /><br />I also wonder how you will manage language barriers, which can really trip up an initiative. For example, I had trouble with the term "training" so I looked for "education" instead. I found a couple of postings, which I gave a thumbs-up. But I still didn't see my idea captured by others, so I posted it, probably too late to attract any votes. <br /><br />So I've identified two challenges: language and timing/process. Some good ideas come late in the process. Some people are cyber-listening before they weigh in.

3702-4049	Wage stagnation, inequality, and economic recovery	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Over the last 3 decades wages have decoupled from productivity and no longer track inflation. Where a single income was sufficient for most families in the decades directly postwar having two incomes today frequently is not, and household debt has ballooned in recent years. At the same time income inequality has reached levels not seen since the 1920s, with most of that growth in the top 0.1%. Whether this level of inequality is something that we as a society want or do not want, we see now that it does not work. This is an economy dominated by domestic consumption, and if household income cannot match inflation and we cannot take on more debt aggregate demand dries up and we face a deflationary spiral.<br /><br />Over the last 30 years the contribution to GDP by the FIRE sector (finance, insurance, real estate) has grown and manufacturing has declined. We have been investing in money, not the things that give money value. But money is just a chit, a claim on goods and services, on capital and infrastructure, fundamentally on labor; and investing in the chit instead of in real wealth makes more chits, not more wealth. This needs to change. The strength of the American economy has been the breadth and depth of a strong and productive middle class. An enormous FIRE sector has been leveraged on top of the middle class, which, while it is more productive than ever, has not been compensated in like manner and is now tapped out. Fixing this will require some tough decisions, as we cannot go back to the days of asset bubble driven high growth powered by massive leverage. Fixing this will likely include a significantly more progressive tax code, downsizing of finance, and a recommitment to domestic manufacturing. We need to invest in those industries relevant to the next 50 years, such as clean energy and sustainability, not the last 50 years. It will probably also mean revisiting how we deal with retirement savings, and savings in general.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>We have just completed a 30 year experiment in declining real wages and increasing income inequality. The experiment failed. If we cannot address these issues successfully we will not have a lsting recovery.</div><br />	alefnot	16	18	2	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3702-4049	
3703-4049	Citizen’s Deliberation on Critical Issues	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Purpose --To facilitate the emergence of an inclusive, legitimate, informed, coherent and trustworthy voice of We the People<br /><br />Introduction:<br />When the Framers of our Constitution met in Philadelphia in 1787, digital media, modern psychology, social psychology, and ecological and systems science did not exist. The deliberative democracy today means integrating the best of face-to-face social collaboration technologies with information and communication technologies for wise governance decisions. <br /><br />The Problem:<br />At the heart of America's liberal democracy are competitive elections, but this design choice does not enhance collective intelligence and wisdom. It fragments communities and societies into reductionist, adversarial "sides" and reduces complex spectra of possibilities to oversimplified "positions" that preclude creative alternatives. The norm is that citizens abdicate decision-making to elected officials, who are in turn heavily influenced by the special interests they must serve to raise money to be re-elected. With few exceptions, existing processes of democracy<br />* Do not provide much effective power to ordinary citizens<br />* Promote at least as much ignorance and distraction as informed public dialogue<br />* Serve special interests better than the general welfare<br />* Impede breakthroughs that could creatively resolve problems and conflicts, and<br />* Undermine the emergence of inclusive community wisdom<br /><br />Voting developed as a process to support self-governance in American history, and at its inception in the 18th century it was new and innovative. In the town halls of New England, citizens gathered together, debated, and decided among themselves those who would hold leadership positions in the community. The method has not scaled to address the wicked (very difficult and complex with no easy answer) problems we as a country and world face. Wicked problems are incomplete, contradictory and have changing requirements; and solutions to them are often difficult to recognize because of their complex interdependencies--solutions may reveal or create more wicked problems. Economic, environmental, social, and political issues are wicked problems.<br /><br />Deliberative Democracy Methods<br />In Tom Atlee's book, The Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World that Works for All (http://www.taoofdemocracy.com/), he highlights several working examples of Citizen Deliberative Councils., including Citizen Jury, Consensus Conference, and Wisdom Council.<br /><br />These efforts have common characteristics that can be replicated in other communities. They are, to some extent, official, with an explicit mandate from government agencies to address public issues or the general concerns of the community. They generate a specific product such as findings or recommendations to the larger community and elected officials. They are real councils, meaning that they are in-person, face-to-face assemblies. Council members are from a fair cross-section of society, often randomly selected peer citizens. These bodies are temporary, not meeting for more than a few weeks. Their efforts are deliberative and balanced, and often facilitated to help participants to understand diverse points of view.<br /><br />These processes were created before the Web existed, and as such were labor intensive, expensive and difficult to scale. But now we have an emerging suite of online tools that can augment these processes and reduce their costs. The right combination of face-to-face deliberation with online tools can be as revolutionary as the self-governance process developed by the Framers in 1787.<br /><br />Any neighborhood council, city council, region, state or even national lawmakers can use these processes to tap the wisdom and decision making potential of the people. <br /><br />There are 7 steps common to these three processes Citizen Deliberative Councils., including Citizen Jury, Consensus Conference, and Wisdom Council each one does it a bit differently. I have a facilitation and a technology background and I worked with Tom Atlee to understand the deeper purpose of each step articulate ways extend the method and explore how technology tools could be used in each step to lower the cost and increase the scalability. We were very clear we don't know "the answer" that the right mix of face to face and online tools to supplement them needs to be found by doing experiments that is researching how to get it to work best. We propose a series of well designed experiments to refine one or several variations that are relatively low cost and very effective. <br /><br />There is a PDF that articulates the steps in each of the three methods and how technology might be used to augment them. http://www.kaliyasblogs.net/papers/CitizenVoices.pdf<br /><br /><br />Here's how online tools can be used in each of the steps. <br /><br />1) Pick an Issue. Choose the topic from all the possible problems that could be tackled. Issues can be surfaced online using popular participation websites such as Digg that allow users to rank issues or polling via a network like Twitter.<br /><br />2) Frame the Issue. Framing an issue for deliberation means describing the range of approaches to an issue and the arguments and evidence for and against each approach. A wiki is the kind of tool that will allow large groups of people (think Wikipedia) to work on understanding and elucidating an issue together.<br /><br />3) Select Deliberators. This step is key to the legitimacy of citizen councils. The selection of deliberators must represent the diversity of the community and be resistant to outside pressures. This gives them a legitimacy that is similar to, but more refined than, the selection of juries, which also seeks to convene a cross-section of the community. Database tools can be used to create unbiased and inclusive selections of deliberators. These same kinds of tools can also be used to pool citizens willing to participate in deliberative councils.<br /><br />4) Collect Information and Expertise. Gathering information from a range of experts and stakeholders about the pros and cons of different approaches is the next step. This is an important factor in both collective intelligence (which learns from and integrates diverse views) and legitimacy (the willingness of ordinary citizens and officials to respect the outcomes of the process). We can find experts via the Web, draw in their expert testimony via web video conferencing, and perhaps have online forums where their knowledge is aggregated. Massive data sets of expert information are now free and available about critical issues, such as environmental toxins and the relationship between lobbying funds and legislation in Congress. These can be compiled, presented and widely shared with visualization tools, using methods beyond prose or PowerPoint to present critical information and tell relevant stories.<br /><br />5) Deliberation. Most citizen deliberative councils involve 12-24 deliberators meeting in concentrated dialogue over four to eight days (distributed over one to ten weeks, depending on the method), led by professional facilitators. Since this may not be feasible in all circumstances, we can use the distributed intelligence of the Web to augment the in-person deliberations. Deliberations can happen both online and face-to-face over time, thus reducing the time and cost. Different algorithmic and semantic tools can be used to help deliberators see patterns of agreement and understanding.<br /><br />6) Decision-Making. It is important to find processes that produce a deliberative Voice of "We the People" that the vast majority of the population will recognize as legitimate. Online tools like Synanim. com build consensus and shared statements using a multi-step online process. Iteration can also happen using methods like Digg or Slash-dot-style voting and community commentary.<br /><br />7) Dissemination and Impact. It is critically important to the ultimate success of citizen deliberative councils that their impact on public awareness, public policy, and public programs be discussed and understood. Online tools are critical to these assessments in a variety of ways. Politicians and other officials should also sign pledges in support of these efforts (this can be a campaign issue) that can be shared online. Ongoing feedback can be integrated and continually shared with the public using online phenomena like Facebook and organized citizen networks to share results and empower "We the People" to ensure its Voice is heard.<br /><br /><br />-------<br />This is based on an article I wrote for Rebooting America Deliberative Democracy in Theory and Practice - http://rebooting.personaldemocracy.com/node/5510<br /><br />Kaliya Hamlin<br />unconference.net <br />identitywoman.net<br />http://www.twitter.com/identitywoman<br />kaliya (at) mac (dot) com<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Without Citizen Deliberation and the distribution of the results of those deliberation the dialogue and wisdom of the people can't deepen it just stays at the level of public "debates".

3708-4049	Strengthen the role of US nonprofit organizations as sites of democratic practice	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Leaders of nonprofit service organizations are committed to building the capacity of those they work with to stand on their own. But they know that service provision by itself will not solve the systemic issues many of their clients face. Human services agencies and nonprofits in general know well that the more clients are educated about the choices available to them for support and the more involved they are in the decision-making about that support, the more likely they are to feel that they are capable and empowered to make decisions about their own lives in general. <br /><br />In due course many of these same agencies are coming to realize that clients educated about issues in their communities and given the opportunity to make decisions about those issues feel empowered to impact those decisions, through initiatives ranging from developing their own community-based programs to lobbying their legislators. With their strong national infrastructure and their reach into low-income and other marginalized communities, community-based nonprofits are identified as places where clients/constituents can be brought into the democratic process to speak up - individually and collectively - for their rights. <br /><br />Nonprofits have often been seen as a cornerstone of U.S. democracy, especially for those who are ignored or marginalized in our society. Over the years the enormous expansion - in number and size of groups - began to demand that nonprofit leaders focus on their organizations, developing their skills to inspire and manage even in uncertain times. As a result, organization leaders have become experts in areas ranging from communications to finance to human resource management to - most importantly - meeting the growing needs of the people they serve even as the organizations themselves struggle to make ends meet. Rarely do they have the time to actually express their role in the democratic process. <br /><br />For almost a decade, the Building Movement Project (http://www.BuildingMovement.org) has been working to advance ways nonprofits can significantly contribute to building movement for progressive social change. We propose that the government support and promote the following initiatives to address how nonprofits can be leaders in engaging their clients, board, volunteers and staff members as active community members who can address the systemic issues that affect their lives:<br /><br />*Develop methods for constituent involvement and leadership in service organizations that transforms the relationship between provider and clients and supports organizational staff on how to move beyond program advisory groups towards constituent civic engagement.<br /><br />*Convene and provide support for alliances of local nonprofit groups that are being pushed to retreat from advances towards social change to give them new commons-based approaches for working together, prioritizing mutual benefit rather than individual advancement.<br /><br />*Make available information, models and tools on issues such as resident and women's leadership, cross-race organizing, and training public and nonprofit mid-level staff on social change/justice issues and how to formulate policy strategies.<br /><br />*Explain how to engage staff and volunteers on issues related to social change/justice and its relationship to service organizations.<br /><br />*Offer support for organizations on how they can raise money from individuals including constituents, with special attention to how groups of color can raise funds in communities of color.<br /><br />*Accelerate discussions and increase the focus on structural solutions that develop multigenerational leadership as older generation leaders in the sector commit to stay in their positions both for financial reasons and to contribute to the current "movement moment", while younger ones seek more influence and voice.<br /><br />*Document and promote organizational structures that are nimble and inclusive for nonprofits interested in attracting a multigenerational workforce and building movement for social change.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Nonprofits have often been seen as a cornerstone of U.S. democracy, especially for those who are ignored or marginalized in our society.

With their strong national infrastructure and their reach into low-income and other marginalized communities, community-based nonprofits are identified as places where clients/constituents can be brought into the democratic process to speak up - individually and collectively - for their rights. </div><br />	carolinebmca	0	8	8	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3708-4049	
3709-4049	Focus on objectives, not alternatives	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Brainstorming is a good start, but far from adequate. Discussion and communication is important, but not enough. Voting is 'democratic' but not an effective nor efficient way to make decisions.<br /><br />A process that focuses on stakeholders' objectives will lead to choices of alternatives that best meet objectives in a way that is open and transparent. It is common for discussions of interested parties to focus on alternatives. This approach, including voting, almost always results in endless dialogs of pointing out the pros of one's favored alternatives and the cons of the others. In contrast, discussions and processes that focus on the relative importance of objectives and the effectiveness of alternatives with respect to these objectives result in more effective solutions that are transparent in the sense that the rationale for the decisions are clear. Even those not in favor of chosen alternatives can understand the rationale for the decisions. <br /><br />Effective ways to address complex issues have been developed and successfully applied over the past 25 years. The one that is most widely used throughout the world today is the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). It is a way to structure, measure and synthesize that is not only theoretically sound, but straightforward. It allows for both objectivity and subjectivity. (See Decision by Objectives by Forman and Selly as well as http://mdm.gwu.edu/forman and http://expertchoice.com. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>There are many ad-hoc process for brainstorming, discussing, voting, making choices and allocating resources. Most of these are deficient in one or more ways that have been addressed in the development of the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Work on AHP started at the Wharton School of Business, and has continued for more than 25 years at The George Washington Univesity School of Business and the University of Pittsburgh. Numerous organizations have successfully applied AHP over the years, including federal, state, and local government agencies, many of the fortune 500 companies, as well as public and private organizations throughout the world. This Analytic Hierarchy Process has the potential to synthesize the ideas, discussions, and analyses of the many people involved in this initiative in a way that leads to effective, transparent conclusions.<br /><br /></div><br />	Professor Ernest Forman	12	14	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3709-4049

For instance, how much are Government officials making in salary, benefits, perks & pensions? At a time when millions of Americans are losing the above, wouldn't it be enlightening to see a readout on how much a Senator is making when he or she is on TV?<br /><br />So often, elected officials present themselves as being 'one of us', and yet they have medical insurance and pension systems not at all similar to the ones legislated to the general public. They can also qualify for these benefits in an absurdly short period of time.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>My hope is that this kind of disclosure would lead to elected officials being unable to create a 2 - tier system, at great advantage to themselves.

3715-4049	Ensuring Availability and Accessibility of Government Data and Information	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The Federal Government has the unprecedented opportunity to open the doors of government to its people through the web. Today, data and information seem to be what the citizens of the United States want more of. Many types of information may be requested, desired, or needed by various audiences that interact with government. Therefore, it is difficult to address the question of how and what data should be made available. Time will answer this question through experimentation and the fulfillment of needs that citizens may not know they had.<br />In order for the government to be successful, it must interact and reach out to the web and technical communities, to gain insight and understanding to the variety of web and technical standards that are currently available and those coming in the future. Incorporating web and technical standards into the government's work and efforts will allow many purposes to be served. Citizens wanting to manipulate data, can gain access to data files; Citizens wanting to access data via a government provided website/application will be able to do so; Citizens wanting to find the data and information via commercial search engines will be able to do so given adoption of semantic and metadata standards, the data and information will be discoverable; Citizens accessing the government data via mobile devices or other multi-channel opportunities, will be able to retrieve information, data, or services from anywhere, and those who have a disability will be able to use tools and technologies to access web based information and pages. Lets start with the web and technical base needed and specifically adopting proven web and technology standards across all agencies to ensure the government has the ability to meet today's and tomorrow's needs of the citizens.<br />From the W3C EGOV IG: http://www.w3.org/2007/eGov/IG/wiki/Main_Page<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Web and technical standards, as tools and proven via best practices, if used, will provide the government with normalized and flexible infrastructure at all levels of technical architecture.

As mentioned previously, today many citizens may not know what types of data or information they want, only after some experimentation and sharing occurs on the part of the Federal Government will the Government and many others begin to realize what is needed, why it is needed, and why it is important.

For those without any other significant income, that means a new payment sometimes arrives 5 weeks after the previous one. Increasing the amount of time it must cover by 25% is pretty serious. Obviously the scheme came up to level out the payments, to unbulge the work of the payers.<br />Might I suggest it be paid on the numbered day of the month which corresponds to the number of the person's birthday? Thus if this hypothetical person was born on the 20th, the check would come on the 20th instead of on the 3rd Wednesay.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>People on fixed income need that income to arrive regularly, not irregularly.

3721-4049	Fix FERPA	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Congress passed FERPA in 1974 to safeguard the privacy of confidential "education records," like grades. But schools and colleges are using FERPA to block disclosure of public records in which there is no legitimate privacy interest. The U.S. Department of Education actually issued an interpretation in December that says schools should withhold even anonymous statistical information about students, such as how many students were disciplined for bringing guns to school and what punishment they received. Congress needs to redefine "confidential education records" to bring sanity back to FERPA and to restore the public's ability to hold schools and colleges accountable.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Education is the largest share of state government spending, and journalists and parents have a legitimate need to know how effectively they are operating.

3726-4049	“Here Are Those Who Care” Project and Grassroots Advocacy Toolkit	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The Rebuilding Alliance's "Here Are Those Who Care" project and Grassroots Advocacy Toolkit will fundamentally change how people think about and engage with international human rights. The project supports this fundamental change by linking communities of like-minded people in local congressional districts, enabling a feedback loop between the people and their government, and encouraging creative ways of enacting and evolving that change over time. <br /><br />The Rebuilding Alliance and the "Here Are Those Who Care," project looks to combine a set of web-based database, mapping, and teleconference tools in a Grassroots Advocacy Toolkit and tests these tools with constituent groups focused on one of our human rights projects, Saving the Kindergarten and Village of Al Aqabah, a West Bank Palestinian community that has received demolition orders. These tools empower U.S. constituents to discover they are not alone and help them find like-minded people who are close-by in their congressional district. The feedback loops formed between the diverse, concerned constituent groups in a congressional district, the "Here Are Those Who Care" coordinator, and congressional staffers grow as questions and concerns raised by the constituents are answered by the congressional staffers via calls on their behalf to the U.S. State Department and foreign embassies.<br /><br />Our Approach: We start by creating a web-based "Grassroots Advocacay Toolkit" that combines the SalesForce.com database with congressional district maps and Googlemaps to show where concerned constituents are located and identify groups who may share the concern. Note that the Salesforce Foundation makes 10 user licenses available to nonprofits without charge (a $15,000/yr value.), and we intend to make our Grassroots Advocacy Toolkit available without cost to that nonprofit network following development and testing. We'll also include social networking (e.g. leveragesoftware.com, lithium.com) and teleconferencing software in our toolkit as well, to facilitate good discussion. However, technology alone is not enough. Hands-on facilitation happens at every level, connecting concerned citizens with the at-risk group overseas via teleconference, with one another, and with their elected representatives.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The "Here Are Those Who Care," project recognizes that elected representatives are more motivated to take action on behalf of any good cause, e.g. the environment, consumer safety, election reform, or, as in our work, international human rights when the campaign is well articulated and constituents form broad coalitions with growing numbers. We seek to end injustice by empowering Americans to contact their elected representatives and senators, exact a positive outcome around the world, and actually visually track the effects of that work from any computer, anywhere. We also help elected representatives learn about issues first-hand in a secure and trustworthy manner through face-to-face meetings and technology common to the business world so that they can better respond to constituent requests and take action.</div><br />	dbw	-2	2	4	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3726-4049

However, in many cases, there is a need to provide assurances to the public that the data/information is in fact accurate and authoritative. Simply providing access to data in, for example, XML format does not provide such assurances.<br /><br />This is especially true as third parties begin to use freely available government information to create new services and sources of information.

This practice, known as participatory budgeting (see ParticipatoryBudgeting.org) is already being practiced in over 1200 cities around the world and it has been endorsed as a best practice of local governance by the United Nations and World Bank. Several countries, such as the UK and Dominican Republic, have already mandated that all local governments initiate participatory budgeting processes. <br /><br />My organization (The Participatory Budgeting Project) is now working with Alderman Joe Moore in Chicago to pilot the first participatory budget using municipal budget funds in the U.S. - http://www.watsoninstitute.org/news_detail.cfm?id=1140<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Participatory budgeting has spread so quickly around the world because it:<br />1) Gives community members a say<br />Ordinary people have more voice â&euro;&ldquo; and they get to make real decisions. Partly because dollars are on the table, participatory budgeting typically attracts people who don't normally participate - especially people of color and low-income residents.<br /><br />2) Makes for better and more equitable decisions<br />Local residents know best what they need. Participatory budgeting has tended to prioritize spending in communities with the greatest needs.<br /><br />3) Develops active and democratic citizens<br />Community members, staff, and officials learn democracy by doing it. They gain more understanding of complex political issues and community needs.<br /><br />4) Builds communities and strengthens community organizations<br />People get to know their neighbors and feel more connected to their city. Local organizations get to spend less time lobbying, and more time deciding policies themselves. Budget assemblies connect groups and attract new members.<br /><br />5) Connects politicians and constituents<br />Politicians build closer relationships with their constituents. Community members get to know their elected officials and local governments.<br /><br />6) Makes government more accountable and efficient<br />When community members decide spending in public assemblies, there are fewer opportunities for corruption, waste, or costly public backlash.<br /><br />Most countries in Latin America and Europe have already started to use participatory budgeting - why not the U.S.?</div><br />	josh_lerner	9	12	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3730-4049	
3731-4049	Alternative model to improve quality of decision making	2009-05-27 00:00:00	An alternative model to improve quality of decision making is not an easy concept to put into words simply. I am constantly trying to improve my decision making in teaching situations, frequently because of inappropriate techniques / methods or misjudgment of thinking/learning styles; which cause me to seek out alternative solutions.<br /><br />I have come across similar theories and creative change across borders probably similar to what many people discussing their ideas on this site have encountered (whole systems theory deliberative dialogue, etc). While all the great strides for collaboration, change and conscious awareness are quite amazing I still find we are losing the vast majority of ordinary people that I meet every day who have no awareness this work is even going on. Therefore, there is not a chance to contribute their input in an informed manner. Educational change can not be effected in isolation from all the other interrelated effects that impinge on it in society. It can not simply be put in place without informing people who have faced many years of experimental educational purposes and without sharing a great deal of very recent new work on these ideas. We are losing the vast majority of people who have no access to this information, discussion or conception. Therefore, what happens does not impact their lives in a way they are aware of. Since everyone is important in diverse ways they have the right to be given a way to find out. If we could resolve the problems of the fear of economic survival people would have more time to be aware of these issues and perhaps we would have a more successful chance of progressing to find out solutions to these issues.<br /><br /> When societal issues and problems are discussed education is rarely mentioned or if it is, it comes last as an afterthought. What is amazing about its noninclusion is that the educational system impacts many of your beliefs. One of my most informative research questions has been: "When you finished school at 18 or 22 what in your education helped you with your life"? An uncomfortably large proportion of people, from all economic or cultural groups most often respond: nothing! A great preponderance of research has documented this outlook which does not diminish from the informational aspect of education.<br /><br />When people grow up they have a different perception=perspective about school. It does not change what they thought and felt when young and is exemplified by the result of what kind of learning that occurs in later life. While the school experience is okay for many people it does not change the fact that 6 out of 10 incoming freshman do not graduate. So we are in effect losing the majority of the population by neglect (which is a form of abuse). I hope to help change the direction of education which as a result of saying one thing and doing the opposite leads to this contradiction. <br /><br />(Disclosure: I am a teacher.) During my teaching experience I have found that what is most sorely lacking is that if no one really listens to you when you are young, you probably will not listen to anyone too often when you are older. I also was disturbed at the great change that often occurs between Kindergarten and the end of first grade, too many had changed into passive and unquestioning students. And so, I became interested in how education impacts this. I find many people rarely question their beliefs from before they were 6. A mind boggling array of underlying problems to the question quickly became apparent and one of the foundations used to make sense of the disparate parts was the use of metadata semantics (search across disciplines). <br /><br /> I have developed a theory which is called the "WHOOSH" hypothesis. It is based on open ended learning and that comprehension happens when one comprehends the "whole" of something but when you break it into parts it will get muddled. [I do not wish to underestimate that we all should share some common foundational background to the cultural morays of each country/culture. For instance, if we all made up our own languages very few people could communicate with each other]. However, if a student is interested in ants, I could enlarge that interest into learning to read, science, math, geography, history, art, music, theory of family life and societal cooperation; to mention a few related subject matters. <br /><br />David Purpel in the "Moral and Spiritual Crisis in Education" has raised some thought provoking ideas that are stated with a eloquence that reflect what I feel and think and so I find no reason to improve on the theory he puts forth. And so, I hope it will be alright to quote him directly.<br /><br />"Chapter 1 / Current crisis in education: professional incompetence or cultural failure?<br />Background: Education and Society<br />Page 2-3 Trivialization of education in America<br />2 major phenomena:<br />1) evasion or neglect of larger, more critical topics;<br />a) enormous energy focused on minor issues such as merit pay / efficacy of homework<br />2) stress put on technical rather than on social, political & moral issues<br />b) urgent concerns of our time - transforming cultural institutions & belief systems must make some drastic changes in our culture to forestall disaster & facilitate growth. Educational Institutions must be a part of that process.<br />The public is once again given the distinct message that schools & education can make serious changes without parallel changes in the basic conception of schooling & in cultural beliefs. Attention is directed to the more modest issues of class electives, schedules of testing, length of school year, & mode of funding rather than to issues of moral numbness, spiritual alienation, nuclear armaments, & terrorism.<br /><br />Page 4 Much of this is due to the intellectual & moral dilemmas implicit in the complex question about the nature & purpose of education. Education has been defined & examined in myriad ways - innumerable perspectives, resulting in genuine perplexity & unsettling uncertainties. The public dialogue on education in America rarely touches upon major theoretical alternatives but rather focuses on the much narrower possibilities within the perspective of existing practices.<br /><br />We educators have for the most part been able (willing) to separate our concern for education from our discussion of our most serious & profound matters. What is the meaning of life? How do we relate as a family, nation, and people. What is a just & fair way of distributing rights & responsibilities? How do we make appropriate moral choices? The irony here is that such questions are quintessentially reflective ones - areas that require knowledge, insight, understanding (i.e., an educated mind). However, we tend in our fragmented & highly differentiated society to equate education with particular institutions & processes which are, if at all, only vaguely linked to deeper social, cultural, economic, & political matters.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line we as a culture accepted general standards of the school budget - for example, classes should be around thirty, with 20 or 25 considered extraordinary, teachers should teach between 25 & 30 hours per week (as opposed to 9 or 12 hours for university professors), students should go to school for 5 or 6 hours per day (unlike college students who divide their 12 to15 hours per week in more flexible and individual ways).<br /><br />These issues raise questions of our social & cultural vision".<br /><br /> Education for too long has taught people to deny who they are and what they know, and to trust, love and respect themselves. Every person should have the opportunity to try to be as fulfilled in their lives and dreams as they want to accomplish and their abilities will take them. No one answer will be right for everyone. I hope to see a future where no one falls through the cracks of being thought important.<br /><br />For an interesting variation of the concept I am putting forth see the forthcoming Matthew B. Crawford book; "(Motorcycle) Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry Into the Value of Work," which will be published this week by Penguin Press.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea is important because what we have been doing isn't working any longer so the time has come to try something different.</div><br />	savannah hawkins	1	2	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3731-4049

3737-4049	Grassroots Cross-Difference Conversations: American Memories and Hopes	2009-05-27 00:00:00	A national program of grassroots cross-difference conversations about our nation's shared history, our place-linked memories, and our hopes for our local, national, and global future would help Americans build our habits and capacities for collaborative democratic governance. It could bring together people who differ in race/ethnicity, religion, generation, gender, sexual orientation, education, occupation, income/wealth, and political affiliation to tell a new, shared story of who we have been as an American people and who we aspire to be as one democratic people among many in our global future. Broad policy goals also would emerge from this process, but its most important aspects would be getting comfortable talking with and learning from neighbors whom we usually have no opportunity to meet. Local conversations could be held in any public or private space in which all neighbors would feel welcome. Memories, hopes, and policy recommendations that each group chooses to report from their local conversation could be gathered and organized by region and state as well as by themes on a White House website that would offer opportunities for comment, including by citizens of other nations.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Because of the differences that have divided us as Americans over the course of our history as well as the busyness of our lives today, we have lost or never learned the habits of talking seriously with our neighbors about our defining memories and hopes for the future. We tend to know only people who are "like us" in terms of a range of differences that we will need to take into account and learn from in order to collaborate democratically in shaping inclusive, equitable, and far-sighted public policies. Thus, we need to start our preparation for playing more active, collaborative roles in democratic governance by getting to know a more diverse set of neighbors while thinking together about what both America and our local community mean to us, as well as what we we hope will be part of our shared future on both of these levels within a globally interlinked world community.</div><br />	greenwoods7	10	10	0	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3737-4049	
3738-4049	Double Database to Monitor the Leahy Amendment	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Why Is This Idea Important?<br />We want to create an intersecting system of two databases to help implement the Leahy Amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act and Defense Appropriations Act by making that information available to the public. As stated on Senator Leahy's website, "The Leahy Law makes it clear that when credible evidence of human rights violations exists, U.S. aid must stop. But, it provides the necessary flexibility to allow the U.S. to advance its foreign policy objectives in these countries. The law gives the Secretary of State the authority to determine when the law applies. In addition, it gives foreign governments an incentive to correct the problem: U.S. aid can resume if they bring to justice people who commit such crimes."<br /><br />To better implement this law, Americans and the world community should have access to an open database of all foreign military units who receive U.S. military aid and/or training. In addition, the State Department's Annual Human Rights reports should be indexed to note those military units that are implicated in any "gross violation of Human Rights." The intersection of these two databases should trigger the implementation of the Leahy Amendment and thus begin a process that will press for justice by withdrawing further U.S. aid and training from the unit involved. <br /><br />Creating the databases for government use is not enough. These databases need to be made public, so both U.S. citizens and foreign military units can have access. U.S. citizens should know what military units are being funded by the U.S. government and keep our country accountable for its spending. Foreign military units must see that they will be held accountable for their actions and place their funding and training at risk if they commit a violation of human rights. <br /><br />_______________________________________________________________<br /><br />Documentation of the Amendments:<br />The Leahy Amendment in the 2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (Sec. 563 of P.L. 106-429) states :"None of the funds made available by this Act may be provided to any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if the Secretary of State has credible evidence that such unit has committed gross violations of human rights, unless the Secretary determines and reports to the Committees on Appropriations that the government of such country is taking effective measures to bring the responsible members of the security forces unit to justice."<br /><br />While the Foreign Operations law covers both training and assistance (such as weapons grants), the Leahy Amendment in the 2001 Defense Appropriations Act (Sec. 8092 of P.L. 106-259) covers only training, and states: "None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to support any training program involving a unit of the security forces of a foreign country if the Secretary of Defense has received credible information from the Department of State that a member of such unit has committed a gross violation of human rights, unless all necessary corrective steps have been taken."<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Human rights advocates realized long ago how important it is to stop a downward spiral of violence in military units. To do nothing does not make the problem disappear; the problem only gets worse. Existing human rights laws have demonstrated their value -- let's use moder technology tools to make these laws easier to monitor.<br /><br /></div><br />	dbw	5	7	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3738-4049

This technology is faster, cheaper and more efficient than air, truck or ship travel and building it would provide jobs. <br />2. Rewire the US for 'the Grid' (the new internet created by CERN) to upgrade our communication and commerce network and, again, create jobs.<br />3. Rework the electrical grid so that it can withstand the 'ups and downs' associated with many alternative energies as well as wiring on streets and highways for low cost recharge parking spots and recharge stations - more jobs and an upgraded grid prepared to handle new energies and electric vehicles.<br />4. R&D; and development of the best alternative energies for various US regions such as the 'wind belt' in the south-west, etc.<br />5. Upgrade gas stations as recharge stations where car batteries are not recharged on site but traded out for 'juiced up' batteries - saving time and making electric recharge wait times a problem of the past.<br />6. R&D; and development of compostable toilet and kitchen technology - the technology already exists but offer incentives for people to upgrade to this technology to reduce solid waste.<br />7. R&D; and development of regional, large scale sort and recycle centers that not only collect all waste, sort, reuse, refurbish and recycle materials but even mine landfills for resources. This industry can replace part or all of the mining industry and provide raw materials for manufacturers. <br />8. Upgrade existing buildings and homes with passive solar and other 'alternative' energy saving technologies with tax incentives while setting high standards for new construction in terms of internal air quality and energy efficiency.<br />9. Upgrade roads and bridges for general safety and improved transportation and commerce.<br />10. Complete and pass the health care legislation that has been prepared so that all Americans are covered and protected. This type of security allows Americans to be more confident to pursue an education or open a business without fearing a lapse in coverage for themselves or their families.<br />11. Upgrade school facilities to support a 21st Century education. Well paid, professional teachers that challenge students to think creatively and critically, consider interdisciplinary and global problems, persevere in their academic pursuits and take risks in their thought as opposed to preparing them for tests on content that anyone can find on the web in 5 minutes - they don't need information - they need thinking skills. They don't need tests, they need to be reflective.<br />12. Random old ideas that have circulated on the right and the left - legalize guns but require background checks, psychological tests and training, support family planning, legalize marijuana and decriminalize millions of Americans while raising tax revenues, streamline the government and minimize waste thereby stabilizing or lowering taxes, support mandatory 2 year military service and mandatory 2 year public works service home and or abroad, make war a last resort in all situations and criminalize companies that promote war when they stand to profit from it.<br /><br /><br />So, what do we get for this? Jobs for Americans in multiple sectors for the next few years. An upgraded infrastructure for communication, transportation and commerce - paving the way for a cleaner and more efficient tomorrow. These incentives improve the environment, the economy, our overall health and quality of life - as a whole, these secure conditions are the foundations upon which a free market economy can flourish.<br /><br />There's more, but I'll wait for my invite to the White House to share!<br /><br />Thanks!

3740-4049	Open Dialogue concerning Marijuana Legalization	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Marijuana legalization is a contentious issue which has recieved an unfair amount of attention from the Federal Government. In addition to government funded programs disseminating information about the negative effects of marijuana, there should also be government funded programs analyzing the costs and benefits of Marijuana legalization and its true impact upon the community. Organizations should be created that employ economists, legal experts, and medical professionals, combining their expertise to make an educated assesment on the effects of marijuana legalization in the country. This information should then be disseminated in a similar fashion as the anti marijuana organizations funded by the Federal government, like abovetheinfluence.com for example.<br /><br />Hundreds of thousands of American citizens are arrested each year for Marijuana posession, a non-violent crime. It would be useful to conduct a comprehensive analysis to determine if it is truely worthwhile to incarcerate these citizens, or if the Illegal nature of the drug is actually doing more damage to our country. Up to now, there has been a one way cherry-picking of information by the federal government to support the notion of keeping marijuana illegal.At the same time, information indicating the benefits of Legalization is not presented by the government, though it is obvious that benefits do exist. This suppression of information needs to be stopped as it is contradictory to the transparent ideals of American government. All sides need to be represented and analyzed fairly.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Hundreds of thousands of American citizens are arrested for Marijuana posession, a non-violent crime.

3744-4049	Incentive to Recycle - Rebate	2009-05-27 00:00:00	We all know the problem of our own trash, look at New Jersey and other communities that have to bear the burden of dealing with toxic dumps in their backyards. Here is my idea to get more people the recycle. Tax incentives would be given out to those that recycle. For the first year the taxpayer would receive a 5% rebate for recycling the whole year.For each year after the first year the incentive would increase by 1.55% for each year of continued recycling or a 12.75% rebate after the six year of exemplary recycling has been met. What is met by exemplary? Exemplary can be defined as having separated each recycled item into the correct container to be picked up. If an item is not in the correct container then the rebate will fall back to 5% for two months at which time the current level of the rebate would be reinstated. You are probably wondering how it would be built, this is fairly easy enough to achieve. First a government branch in the military would be formed via the base sanitary commission that would be responsible for ensuring all recyclables were disposed of properly. These individuals would go through the initial training phase that is required for all the branches and after serving a two year tour either stateside of overseas would have the choice the of re-enlisting or being discharged into the USRS (Unites States Recycling Service)where they would preform the same collection and administration duties as was preformed in the military. These members would also be required to continue to remain on a reserve status for six years where their reserve status would be of the same type as the regular reserve. This unit would be responsible for the collection, separation of and transportation of any number of items as set forth as being deemed as a recyclable. This unit would also be able to hire non-government employees to fill in the roles vacant by the government employee through a temporary to hire basis. One way to become a permanent employee would be to enlist in any of the four main branches of the military, Marines, Army, Navy, Air Force for two years plus training time plus six years of reserve duty. Another way for a civilian to become employed on a permanent basis is to be furthering their education in ecological resource management, sanitary management or any classification of higher education relating to environmental sciences. If hired as a civilian contractor, the employee would be required to be employed with a temporary agency for no less then six months with the USRS or until above satisfactory qualifications have been met. Civilians not meeting the above criteria could become permanently employed with the USRS through one year of above satisfactory employment as a driver or thrower through which the employee would be required to have obtained a CDL prior to being employed with the USRS. The civilian non-educated employee could then enroll in various classes as taught by the military instructors with assistance from their civilian educatee's. This type of continuing education will provide the non-educated civilian with a associates degree in resource management that would be learned over a two year period. <br /><br />The collection of the recycled items would be delegated to paper/cardboard, metals, plastic and foam products all of which would be separated into the appropriate container or bag. Identification of each Rebate customer would be achieved by using a bar code scanner system at the point of contact ( weather resistant bar code affixed to the mail box post) as well as papered bar codes. Each time a stop is made the driver scans their sheet for the customer's bar code to record the pickup. The bar code on the mailbox post is a secondary means of recording if for some reason a bar code should not be present for the customer in papered form. If the customer does not have any items to be recycled on the given day of pickup then a penalty of 1.00% reduction in the rebate will occur. If the customer does not recycle for two weeks in a row, then the rebate will be revoked until items to be recycled are then placed at the point of contact where the initial rebate of 5% will be reinstated.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea is important for several reason's the most importantly being the reprocessing of used resources that would otherwise be dumped in landfill and cause environmental problems, job creation as well as incentives to further higher education.</div><br />	dwighthuth	9	12	3	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3744-4049

3750-4049	Implement the Recommendations found in the 1997 US Senate Report on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy 	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The effort to enhance USG openness is not new. Indeed, as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote in his 1998 book "Secrecy": "... secrecy is for losers. For people who don't know how important information really is. The Soviet Union realized this too late. Openness is now a singular, and singularly American, advantage. We put it in peril by poking along in an age now past. It is time to dismantle government secrecy, the most pervasive of Cold-war era regulations. It is time to begin building the supports for the era of openness that is already upon us." <br /><br />While Moynihan left us a few years ago, American would do well to take his legacy to heart, and to keep his and our great nation's love of openness alive and thriving. <br /><br />More specifically, in 1997 the US Senate established a Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy. This commission was chaired by Senator Moynihan. Its recommendations continue to be outstanding ones that should be fully implemented today. The entire report of this commission is found online at: http://www.gpo.gov/congress/commissions/secrecy/index.html<br />A summary of this commission's recommendations follow: <br /><br />1. The Commission recommends enactment of a statute establishing the principles on which<br />Federal classification and declassification programs are to be based. (p. 13)<br />2. The Commission recommends that the Security Policy Board (SPB) implement within one year<br />the Joint Security Commission recommendation on establishing a single set of security standards<br />for special access programs (SAPs). The SPB, in conjunction with the Department of Defense,<br />should examine whether the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual Supplement<br />should continue to allow individual SAP program managers to select the security measures for<br />their program rather than conform to a single standard. Industrial contractors should be included<br />in this review and in the development of a single set of standards. (p. 28)<br />3. The Commission recommends that agencies take several steps to enhance the proficiency of<br />classifiers and improve their accountability by requiring additional information on the rationale for<br />classification, by improving classification guidance, and by strengthening training and evaluation<br />programs.<br />Elements of this approach should include:<br />•Original classifiers shall provide a detailed justification for each original classification<br />decision;<br />•Derivative classifiers shall be required to identify themselves on the documents<br />they classify;<br />•Classification guides shall be better developed, more definitive, and updated<br />regularly, and industry shall participate in the preparation of guides affecting<br />industrial programs;<br />•Training shall be expanded to include derivative classifiers and shall conform to<br />minimum Executive Branch standards; and<br />•Proper classification of information shall be included as a critical element in the<br />performance evaluations of all employees authorized to classify. (p. 34)<br />4. The Commission recommends that classification decisions, including the establishment of<br />special access programs, no longer be based solely on damage to the national security. Additional<br />factors, such as the cost of protection, vulnerability, threat, risk, value of the information, and<br />public benefit from release, could also be considered when making classification decisions. (p. 38)<br />5. The Commission recommends that responsibility for classification and declassification policy<br />development and oversight be assigned to a single Executive Branch body, designated by the<br />President and independent of the agencies that classify. This entity should have sufficient resources<br />and be empowered to carry out oversight of agency practices and to develop policy.<br />Based on its oversight findings, this body would then make recommendations for policy and<br />implementation of classification and declassification issues directly to the National Security<br />Council. The Security Policy Board would have an opportunity to comment on these policy<br />recommendations through the NSC process. (p. 44)<br />C-1<br />Appendix C: Summary of Recommendations<br />C-2<br />6. The Commission recommends the creation by statute of a central office--a National Declassification<br />Center--at an existing Federal agency such as the National Archives and Records<br />Administration to coordinate national declassification policy and activities. This Center would<br />have the responsibility, authority, and funds sufficient to coordinate, oversee, and implement<br />government declassification activities. The Center would monitor agency declassification<br />programs and provide annual reports on their status to the Congress and the President. (p. 68)<br />7. The Commission recommends that the use of sources and methods as a basis for the<br />continuing classification of intelligence information be clarified through issuance of an Intelligence<br />Community directive by the Director of Central Intelligence, explaining the appropriate scope of<br />that protection. (p. 70)<br />8. The Commission recommends that agencies better structure their records management and<br />systematic declassification programs to maximize access to records that are likely to be the<br />subject of significant public interest.<br />Elements of this proposal should include:<br />•Complying with the dates or events for declassification, including through the use<br />of new technologies;<br />•Consolidating and regularly updating declassification guidance that is easily<br />accessible to those authorized to declassify within the agency;<br />•Prioritizing declassification according to entire record groups selected through<br />active consultation with the public and outside scholars, and regularly informing<br />the public of systematic review results;<br />•Requiring all offices with any declassification-related activities to demonstrate<br />that they are operating in partnership with others in the agency involved in related<br />activities; and<br />•Establishing ombudsman offices in each agency that has original classification<br />authority or engages in declassifying records: these offices would intervene in<br />and resolve classification and declassification issues upon request, act as a<br />conduit for public concerns about access to records, and, where appropriate, refer<br />issues to the agency's Inspector General. (p. 71)<br />9. The Commission recommends five guiding principles as the essential elements of an effective<br />personnel security system. Most already are part of the current system (including under Executive<br />Order 12968), but too often they are not actually practiced throughout the Federal Government.<br />The Commission recommends that these standards be incorporated into a new statute or<br />regulation that would supersede Executive Order 10450.<br />The five guiding principles are:<br />•Openness and clarity of standards;<br />•Balanced, "whole-person" standards;<br />•Reciprocity for classified access;<br />•Nondiscrimination principles; and<br />•Assurances of due process. (p. 80)<br />10. The Commission recommends that individuals in both Government and industry holding valid<br />clearances be able to move from one agency or special program to another without further<br />Appendix C: Summary of Recommendations<br />C-3<br />investigation or adjudication. The single exception to this true reciprocity of security clearances<br />shall be that agencies may continue to require the polygraph before granting access. (p. 82)<br />11. The Commission recommends that current requirements for neighborhood interviews and for<br />interviewing educational references in every investigation be eliminated. (p. 86)<br />12. The Commission recommends that greater balance be achieved between the initial clearance<br />process and programs for continuing evaluation of cleared employees. (p. 87)<br />13. The Commission recommends that both the Congress and the Executive Branch reevaluate<br />the requirement to utilize a new financial disclosure form and consider staying its implementation<br />until there is further evaluation concerning how it would be used and whether its benefits exceed<br />its costs. The Congress and the Executive Branch should review alternative approaches to<br />improving data collection, including utilization of the expanded access to certain financial and<br />travel records provided for under Executive Order 12968. (p. 89)<br />14. The Commission recommends that: (1) the director of scientific research at the Department<br />of Defense Polygraph Institute establish a committee that includes cleared, outside scientific<br />experts to develop a coherent research agenda on the polygraph; initiate and participate in a small<br />grant program to stimulate independent research outside the Government; and review and comment<br />on scientific progress and the quality of government-sponsored research in this field; and<br />(2) independent, objective, and peer-reviewed scientific research be encouraged as the best<br />means to assess the credibility of the polygraph as a personnel security tool and identify potential<br />technological advances that could make the polygraph more effective in the future. (p. 91)<br />15. The Commission recommends revising the Computer Security Act of 1987 to reflect the<br />realities of information systems security in the Information Age.<br />Some of the changes to the Act might include:<br />•Moving the Computer Systems Laboratory from the National Institute of Standards<br />and Technology to a higher visibility position within the Commerce Department,<br />thereby increasing the likelihood of funding and personnel to support the<br />civilian side of Government;<br />•Directing agencies to set aside specific funds, perhaps as a budget line item, for<br />information systems security training; and<br />•Requiring the Office of Personnel Management to create a career path for<br />information systems security professionals that includes network administration<br />and computer crime investigation. (p. 104)<br />16. The Commission recommends developing an information systems security career path across<br />the Government.

3752-4049	A National Strategy for Sustainability would provide a good means for reconciling Strategic Planning and Budgeting	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The Citizens Network for Sustainable Development has been urging our federal government to fulfill it's commitment to develop and implement a National Strategy for Sustainability for more than ten years now. I posted an idea and proposal on this idea yesterday (May 27) under the category of New Strategies and Techniques of Participation. It has already gotten quite a few votes and will probably receive substantially more than this posting. See: http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3299-4049. A National Strategy will not focus on just one or two components or criteria for better and more open government, but instead on most aspects of this challenge. I am thus including a description below of how a National Strategy for Sustainability could be used to address most of the categories that are listed in the Open Government Dialogue. <br /><br />The Citizens Network for Sustainable Development is urging the Obama Administration and Congress to lead our country and people in Developing and Implementing a National Strategy for Sustainability, as agreed to by all of the UN Member States during both the Rio Earth Summit Conference in 1992 and the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. Indeed all countries agreed to "begin to implement their National Strategy Plans by 2005", so we are already several years behind in fulfilling this important commitment. <br /><br />President Obama has repeatedly stated that his Administration will be both a good global citizen and will contribute substantially to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Developing and implementing a National Strategy for Sustainability is needed to fulfill Millennium Development Goal #7 which calls for "ensuring environmental sustainability" and "integrating the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programs and reversing the loss of environmental resources."<br /><br />TRANSPARENCY <br /><br />One of the primary objectives, goals, and components of a National Strategy for Sustainability should be to provide more transparency within government at all levels. Mechanisms should be developed as a part of the implementation process to make data more accessible, make government operations more visible, and to provide open access to key information such as is applicable to the primary indicators that are used to measure and assess progress that is being made to implement the sustainability plan. <br /><br />PARTICIPATION<br /><br />The work of existing and new Federal Advisory Committees should be integrated into both the development and implementation of the National Strategy for Sustainability. In fact some type of an independent National Council on Sustainable Development should be created, with a mandate and structure similar to that of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Public Administration, which will act as a Federal Advisory Committee for most purposes. <br /><br />Many of the recommendations that come from the National Strategy Process could be instituted either as Executive Orders or as federal, state, and local rules, regulations, or legislation. In fact one of the primary goals of the process would be to evaluate existing rules, regulations, and legislation to determine whether they are sufficient for achieving set and agreed upon goals and then to take sufficient action to ensure that they are sufficient for achieving the goals. <br /><br />COLLABORATION<br /><br />Collaboration within, between and among various levels of government should be one of the primary focuses of the National Strategy. Indeed regional coordinating bodies and councils are needed at various levels of government to ensure that adequate processes are in place for efficient coordination, collaboration, and implementation. The President's Council on Sustainable Development included many recommendations for such coordinating bodies and councils which ought to be acted upon, including a Joint Center on Sustainable Communities. I am including a summary of many of the primary recommendations from the President's Council below. See: http://clinton5.nara.gov/PCSD <br /><br />In addition, one of the key contributions that the development of a National Strategy could make would be to encourage and support the development of citizen initiatives and public-private partnerships. Indeed the focus on Sustainable Development, both in the US and around the world, has seen a growing interest and dedication to public-private partnerships which are particularly apparent in the recent development of UN Partnership Initiatives - of which both the Bush and Obama Administrations have championed and paid a great deal of interest. Indeed the National Strategy could serve as a primary means for raising awareness in the US, among stakeholders, government entities, and the public, about the work and efforts of these UN Partnerships and how the US can participate and take advantage more so in and of their development. <br /><br />CAPACITY BUILDING<br /><br />Another primary emphasis of the National Strategy should be to encourage and support Capacity Building and Development. At both the local level and within industries, municipalities and businesses have provided and undergone a great deal of training and staff development as they have developed their own sustainability plans. However, this is still far from universal and similar activities could now be more fruitfully developed as well at the state and federal levels. Development and implementation of a National Strategy could thus serve to foster and support the further development of such training and development programs. <br /><br />In addition, there is a growing interest within the academic community in integrating Education for Sustainable Development throughout the curriculum - as mandated in the Outcome Document of the World Summit on Sustainable Development and the UN Decade on Education for Sustainable Development. The extent to which the U.S. Department of Education; federal, state, and local governments; and our educational institutions support and promote efforts to educate and train professors, teachers, and students about the basic principles, attributes, and components of sustainable development is also the extent to which our country will be prepared for the social, economic, and environmental challenges and requirements that are likely to confront us, and that we must deal with, in the 21st century. <br /><br />Going beyond this, one of the key lessons that was learned from the President's Council on Sustainable Development is the imperative need to publicize and promote the efforts to develop and implement the National Strategy for Sustainability in as broad and energetic a way as possible. One reason that more of the recommendations from the President's Council were not implemented was that the process was not sufficiently promoted, especially in the earlier years. <br /><br />Indeed all Americans must be made aware of the planning and implementation efforts and encouraged and welcomed to participate fully in the process. Indeed one of the primary components of the National Strategy should be to focus on communication strategies and an open and participatory process should be developed to enroll and involve as many people, stakeholders, and professionals in the communication process as possible. Just imagine the great suggestions and contributions that might come from the business community, students, and educators to enhance and promote the communication processes. <br /><br />Indeed some great work is already being done by students, alternative and mass media, in local communities, and by professional organizations in order to promote the need and raise awareness about sustainable development - of which I could provide many excellent examples - including the Earth Team (http://www.earthteam.net); Guerrilla in the Greenhouse (http://www.greengorilla.com); Captain Planet Foundation (http://captainplanetfdn.org); NBC's Green Is Universal; Free Range Studios; GoodWorks Public Relations (http://www.goodworkspr.com); and Sustainable Today (http://SustainableToday.org); etc. <br /><br />Finally, one of the primary components of the National Strategy should focus on Strategic Planning and Budgeting. In fact the development and implementation of the Strategy Plan could provide an excellent means of engaging the concerned public in planning and budgetary processes and indeed has often resulted in such interest at the local and state levels to date. In addition, sustainability indicators, Genuine Progress Indicators, and other assessment tools have often done a much better job of analyzing real world impacts than have more strictly defined economic indicators and also of including crucially important externalities in decision-making processes. <br /><br />As you can see the development and implementation of a National Strategy for Sustainability could serve as a key vehicle and strategy for improving the operations, transparency, participation, and collaboration in government and at all levels. <br /><br /><br />===============================================<br /><br />Suggested Components and Activities for a<br />National Strategy for Sustainability<br /><br />Prepared by Rob Wheeler<br />Citizens Network for Sustainable Development<br /><br /><br />The proposed components included below were drawn primarily from the work of the President's Council on Sustainable Development which met and solicited input from the American public in the 1990s. The Council's proposals and recommendations should be reconsidered and augmented through a national effort to: develop a National Strategy for Sustainability and fulfill the commitments made by the US government during the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in September 2002. <br /><br />The reports and recommendations from the President's Council on Sustainable Development are archived and can be downloaded at: http://clinton5.nara.gov/PCSD. <br /><br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />Some type of a National Council on Sustainable Development should again be established to lead the effort to develop and implement a National Strategy for Sustainability in the US. The role of the Council should be to:<br /><br />A) Forge Consensus on Policy<br />B) Demonstrate Implementation of Policy<br />C) Get The Word Out <br />D) Evaluate and Report on Progress Made<br /><br />The National Strategy should:<br /><br />Establish a White House Office which would have the authority to coordinate and integrate economic, social, and environmental policy throughout the Executive Branch and oversee implementation efforts for the National Strategy Plan.<br /><br />Establish a new Interagency Working Group on Sustainable Development, again co-chaired by the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and the Chair of the National Economic Council. The Interagency Working Group should review and conduct a new survey of existing and needed federal programs and activities that could support and implement the recommendations coming from the past and present PCSD. The Interagency Working Group should recommend the means to include these programs and activities in the National Strategy Plan, following appropriate consultations.<br /><br />The role of the Federal Government should be to:<br /><br />Sponsor and promote a national dialogue to consider and develop recommendations as to how our country can make a rapid transition to full sustainability. <br /><br />Develop and promote a national plan for shifting to full sustainability, including the specific steps which will need to be taken and the programs implemented in each sector or issue area.<br /><br />Publish a catalogue of tools for initiating, leading, and implementing sustainable development efforts. Maintain an information clearinghouse to disseminate examples of best practices and community initiatives of value to county, city, state, federal, private sector, non-profit, and academic organizations.<br /><br />Conduct policy analysis through a series of public forums on both governmental and private sector policies that contribute to building healthy communities.<br /><br />Establish and support the work and activities of the Joint Center for Sustainable Communities<br /><br />Promote and support the development of Eco-Industrial Parks<br /><br />Develop a national plan and program for Sustainable Production and Consumption; and establish a federal focal point for the promotion and coordination of Extended Product Responsibility.<br /><br />Provide sustainable community grants to cities and counties for local efforts to develop community-based strategies. Develop sustainable community awards programs to recognize outstanding efforts within communities, community programs, and their elected officials. Develop a peer exchange program to match experienced elected officials and professional staff who have proven solutions with jurisdictions that need to solve specific problems.<br /><br />Develop a program to support initiatives and activities in rural areas and communities.<br /><br />Develop and adopt federal metropolitan-scale policy through an Interagency Metropolitan Sustainable Development Working Group. Coordinate its activities with other interagency groups such as the Community Empowerment Board (CEB) and the Interagency Brownfields Initiative. Establish a pilot demonstration program to encourage metropolitan cooperation and problem solving.<br /><br />Help to facilitate the creation of regional councils modeled after the PCSD's multi-stakeholder process. Establish federal interagency groups to work with the regional councils. Connect the critical issues of metropolitan and rural areas within each region to determine joint needs and collaborative solutions. Help the various regional councils to coordinate their efforts and work together to promote and implement sustainable development policies and practices.<br /><br />Sponsor a national dialogue on the need for Education for Sustainable Development and take leadership in implementing a national effort to include it as a core part of the curriculum in schools throughout the United States. Support and implement the recommendations from the Education for Sustainability: Agenda for Action process. <br /><br />Support the work and activities of the Sustainable Communities Network (SCN), connecting citizens nationwide with the resources they need to implement innovative processes and programs to restore the economic, environmental, and social health and vitality of their communities.<br /><br />Develop a national advertising and educational campaign designed to help local elected officials and private citizens understand the importance of locally-based community action and to promote the National Strategy Plan for implementing sustainable development.<br /><br />Rob Wheeler<br />robineagle@worldcitizen.org<br />1-717-264-5036<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Rob  Wheeler	3	5	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3752-4049

I am thus including a description below of how a National Strategy for Sustainability could be used to address most of the categories that are listed in the Open Government Dialogue. <br /><br />The Citizens Network for Sustainable Development is urging the Obama Administration and Congress to lead our country and people in Developing and Implementing a National Strategy for Sustainability, as agreed to by all of the UN Member States during both the Rio Earth Summit Conference in 1992 and the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. Indeed all countries agreed to "begin to implement their National Strategy Plans by 2005", so we are already several years behind in fulfilling this important commitment. <br /><br />President Obama has repeatedly stated that his Administration will be both a good global citizen and will contribute substantially to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Developing and implementing a National Strategy for Sustainability is needed to fulfill Millennium Development Goal #7 which calls for "ensuring environmental sustainability" and "integrating the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programs and reversing the loss of environmental resources."<br /><br />TRANSPARENCY <br /><br />One of the primary objectives, goals, and components of a National Strategy for Sustainability should be to provide more transparency within government at all levels. Mechanisms should be developed as a part of the implementation process to make data more accessible, make government operations more visible, and to provide open access to key information such as is applicable to the primary indicators that are used to measure and assess progress that is being made to implement the sustainability plan. <br /><br />PARTICIPATION<br /><br />The work of existing and new Federal Advisory Committees should be integrated into both the development and implementation of the National Strategy for Sustainability. In fact some type of an independent National Council on Sustainable Development should be created, with a mandate and structure similar to that of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Public Administration, which will act as a Federal Advisory Committee for most purposes. <br /><br />Many of the recommendations that come from the National Strategy Process could be instituted either as Executive Orders or as federal, state, and local rules, regulations, or legislation. In fact one of the primary goals of the process would be to evaluate existing rules, regulations, and legislation to determine whether they are sufficient for achieving set and agreed upon goals and then to take sufficient action to ensure that they are sufficient for achieving the goals. <br /><br />COLLABORATION<br /><br />Collaboration within, between and among various levels of government should be one of the primary focuses of the National Strategy. Indeed regional coordinating bodies and councils are needed at various levels of government to ensure that adequate processes are in place for efficient coordination, collaboration, and implementation. The President's Council on Sustainable Development included many recommendations for such coordinating bodies and councils which ought to be acted upon, including a Joint Center on Sustainable Communities. I am including a summary of many of the primary recommendations from the President's Council below. See: http://clinton5.nara.gov/PCSD <br /><br />In addition, one of the key contributions that the development of a National Strategy could make would be to encourage and support the development of citizen initiatives and public-private partnerships. Indeed the focus on Sustainable Development, both in the US and around the world, has seen a growing interest and dedication to public-private partnerships which are particularly apparent in the recent development of UN Partnership Initiatives - of which both the Bush and Obama Administrations have championed and paid a great deal of interest. Indeed the National Strategy could serve as a primary means for raising awareness in the US, among stakeholders, government entities, and the public, about the work and efforts of these UN Partnerships and how the US can participate and take advantage more so in and of their development. <br /><br />CAPACITY BUILDING: TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT<br /><br />Another primary emphasis of the National Strategy should be to encourage and support Capacity Building and Development. At both the local level and within industries, municipalities and businesses have provided and undergone a great deal of training and staff development as they have developed their own sustainability plans. However, this is still far from universal and similar activities could now be more fruitfully developed as well at the state and federal levels. Development and implementation of a National Strategy could thus serve to foster and support the further development of such training and development programs. <br /><br />In addition, there is a growing interest within the academic community in integrating Education for Sustainable Development throughout the curriculum - as mandated in the Outcome Document of the World Summit on Sustainable Development and the UN Decade on Education for Sustainable Development. The extent to which the U.S. Department of Education; federal, state, and local governments; and our educational institutions support and promote efforts to educate and train professors, teachers, and students about the basic principles, attributes, and components of sustainable development is also the extent to which our country will be prepared for the social, economic, and environmental challenges and requirements that are likely to confront us, and that we must deal with, in the 21st century. <br /><br />Going beyond this, one of the key lessons that was learned from the President's Council on Sustainable Development is the imperative need to publicize and promote the efforts to develop and implement the National Strategy for Sustainability in as broad and energetic a way as possible. One reason that more of the recommendations from the President's Council were not implemented was that the process was not sufficiently promoted, especially in the earlier years. <br /><br />Indeed all Americans must be made aware of the planning and implementation efforts and encouraged and welcomed to participate fully in the process. Indeed one of the primary components of the National Strategy should be to focus on communication strategies and an open and participatory process should be developed to enroll and involve as many people, stakeholders, and professionals in the communication process as possible. Just imagine the great suggestions and contributions that might come from the business community, students, and educators to enhance and promote the communication processes. <br /><br />Indeed some great work is already being done by students, alternative and mass media, in local communities, and by professional organizations in order to promote the need and raise awareness about sustainable development - of which I could provide many excellent examples - including the Earth Team (http://www.earthteam.net); Guerrilla in the Greenhouse (http://www.greengorilla.com); Captain Planet Foundation (http://captainplanetfdn.org); NBC's Green Is Universal; Free Range Studios; GoodWorks Public Relations (http://www.goodworkspr.com); and Sustainable Today (http://SustainableToday.org); etc. <br /><br />Finally, one of the primary components of the National Strategy should focus on Strategic Planning and Budgeting. In fact the development and implementation of the Strategy Plan could provide an excellent means of engaging the concerned public in planning and budgetary processes and indeed has often resulted in such interest at the local and state levels to date. In addition, sustainability indicators, Genuine Progress Indicators, and other assessment tools have often done a much better job of analyzing real world impacts than have more strictly defined economic indicators and also of including crucially important externalities in decision-making processes. <br /><br />As you can see the development and implementation of a National Strategy for Sustainability could serve as a key vehicle and strategy for improving the operations, transparency, participation, and collaboration in government and at all levels. <br /><br /><br />===============================================<br /><br />Suggested Components and Activities for a<br />National Strategy for Sustainability<br /><br />Prepared by Rob Wheeler<br />Citizens Network for Sustainable Development<br /><br /><br />The proposed components included below were drawn primarily from the work of the President's Council on Sustainable Development which met and solicited input from the American public in the 1990s. The Council's proposals and recommendations should be reconsidered and augmented through a national effort to: develop a National Strategy for Sustainability and fulfill the commitments made by the US government during the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in September 2002. <br /><br />The reports and recommendations from the President's Council on Sustainable Development are archived and can be downloaded at: http://clinton5.nara.gov/PCSD. <br /><br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />Some type of a National Council on Sustainable Development should again be established to lead the effort to develop and implement a National Strategy for Sustainability in the US. The role of the Council should be to:<br /><br />A) Forge Consensus on Policy<br />B) Demonstrate Implementation of Policy<br />C) Get The Word Out <br />D) Evaluate and Report on Progress Made<br /><br />The National Strategy should:<br /><br />Establish a White House Office which would have the authority to coordinate and integrate economic, social, and environmental policy throughout the Executive Branch and oversee implementation efforts for the National Strategy Plan.<br /><br />Establish a new Interagency Working Group on Sustainable Development, again co-chaired by the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and the Chair of the National Economic Council. The Interagency Working Group should review and conduct a new survey of existing and needed federal programs and activities that could support and implement the recommendations coming from the past and present PCSD. The Interagency Working Group should recommend the means to include these programs and activities in the National Strategy Plan, following appropriate consultations.<br /><br />The role of the Federal Government should be to:<br /><br />Sponsor and promote a national dialogue to consider and develop recommendations as to how our country can make a rapid transition to full sustainability. <br /><br />Develop and promote a national plan for shifting to full sustainability, including the specific steps which will need to be taken and the programs implemented in each sector or issue area.<br /><br />Publish a catalogue of tools for initiating, leading, and implementing sustainable development efforts. Maintain an information clearinghouse to disseminate examples of best practices and community initiatives of value to county, city, state, federal, private sector, non-profit, and academic organizations.<br /><br />Conduct policy analysis through a series of public forums on both governmental and private sector policies that contribute to building healthy communities.<br /><br />Establish and support the work and activities of the Joint Center for Sustainable Communities<br /><br />Promote and support the development of Eco-Industrial Parks<br /><br />Develop a national plan and program for Sustainable Production and Consumption; and establish a federal focal point for the promotion and coordination of Extended Product Responsibility.<br /><br />Provide sustainable community grants to cities and counties for local efforts to develop community-based strategies. Develop sustainable community awards programs to recognize outstanding efforts within communities, community programs, and their elected officials. Develop a peer exchange program to match experienced elected officials and professional staff who have proven solutions with jurisdictions that need to solve specific problems.<br /><br />Develop a program to support initiatives and activities in rural areas and communities.<br /><br />Develop and adopt federal metropolitan-scale policy through an Interagency Metropolitan Sustainable Development Working Group. Coordinate its activities with other interagency groups such as the Community Empowerment Board (CEB) and the Interagency Brownfields Initiative. Establish a pilot demonstration program to encourage metropolitan cooperation and problem solving.<br /><br />Help to facilitate the creation of regional councils modeled after the PCSD's multi-stakeholder process. Establish federal interagency groups to work with the regional councils. Connect the critical issues of metropolitan and rural areas within each region to determine joint needs and collaborative solutions. Help the various regional councils to coordinate their efforts and work together to promote and implement sustainable development policies and practices.<br /><br />Sponsor a national dialogue on the need for Education for Sustainable Development and take leadership in implementing a national effort to include it as a core part of the curriculum in schools throughout the United States. Support and implement the recommendations from the Education for Sustainability: Agenda for Action process. <br /><br />Support the work and activities of the Sustainable Communities Network (SCN), connecting citizens nationwide with the resources they need to implement innovative processes and programs to restore the economic, environmental, and social health and vitality of their communities.<br /><br />Develop a national advertising and educational campaign designed to help local elected officials and private citizens understand the importance of locally-based community action and to promote the National Strategy Plan for implementing sustainable development.<br /><br />Rob Wheeler<br />robineagle@worldcitizen.org<br />1-717-264-5036<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div></div><br />	Rob  Wheeler	14	15	1	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3754-4049

Many Americans would jump at the chance to make their own choices for education (private, charter, online, tutoring, home schooling, etc.) given the freedom to do so.<br /><br />Several specific approaches that could be tried separately or in parallel, including vouchers and tax credit approaches, are described briefly at http://www.friedmanfoundation.org/schoolchoice/<br /><br />The federal government should immediately begin promoting pilot programs and studies of effectiveness. Initial programs could be focused on underprivileged groups, doing the most good with the initial experimental efforts.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The obvious major goals are to improve the quality of education through competition, reduce the cost of education through competition and innovation, and increase freedom and liberty by giving families choices.</div><br />	commercial	6	13	7	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3755-4049	
3756-4049	Public Notices and Public Policy	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Prominent new websites like recovery.gov and data.gov are an important part of making the process of pulling information out of the federal government more efficient. But websites are only a piece of a communications strategy. Public notice--which aggressively pushes information beyond the government confines--is a critical element of the nation's accountability mechanisms. Websites alone are not enough. First, broad swaths of the public still are not active online. Second, government websites tend to have fairly low readership--and when the desired audience goes beyond the usual stakeholders of an agency, it is not likely information will be found when solely on a website. Third, web information lacks fixity, and is expensive to archive and keep. This project must reach beyond the activities of building web functions and continue into a broader "push out" effort of information. Public notices traditionally have been delivered by mail, by newspaper and in the federal government's case, via the Federal Register. Accessible archives have been available through federal repository libraries. <br /><br />This project should examine when information is so important that a passive posting by the government is not sufficient, define the mechanisms for helping agencies make that determination, and then proceed to build in the elements that have traditionally been part of public notices: they are accessible to the general public; they are archivable; they are verifiable and they are published through an independent medium that can help to hold the publishing entity accountable. In the Web 2.0 environment, a piece of the independent medium is recognizing that building audience is not a forte of the government. How will web-notice dovetail with print notice? Are we in a transitional period where print will be less necessary--and if so, how can electronic media replicate the permanance and fixed medium values in print? Will notice effectively be given through media websites, where audience is more easily found? These questions need to be part of the deliberation.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Openness cannot be solely a passive value. In addition to making information available, government must affirmatively take action on many matters to push the information out to the public. Developing databases and records systems and posting them is a critical element in effective transparency. But it is one avenue and not an end in itself </div><br />	trush	15	16	1	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3756-4049	
3757-4049	A Whole Systems Training Approach: Leadership for Four Stages of Transition from Crisis to Resilience	2009-05-27 00:00:00	Many of the suggestions for creating Open Government advocate for open forums for dialog and deliberation. How do we get there from here? <br /><br />Let's consider some of the factors that contribute to where we are before we can talk about where we're going: We are having a financial meltdown affecting every person, community and state in this country. We are spending at least half of our budget on war and all its components and don't have enough funds for domestic needs. Our schools and infrastructure are a huge mess, on the verge of disaster in many places. Climate change is causing more natural disasters. Our political system and its citizens are polarized. We are in crisis or heading that way. Another challenge to implementing Open Government is that our history and culture is one of domination, by class, by authority, by race, religion, gender. We don't have the cultural habits of mutual respect, working for mutual benefit, consideration, cooperation, inclusion, generosity, and kindness. All among the qualities needed for true democracy.<br /><br />We will be more successful by approaching the transition to open government by understanding the stages of culture from a state of crisis to the potential of building a resilient true democracy. By learning to recognize the stage the group or individuals are in facilitators can use the most effective leadership strategies and support the needs of the situation. <br /><br />We can expand the corps of leaders, public, government and private, knowledgeable in 1. crisis management, 2. creating security, 3. helping groups become proactive and 4. building resilience though dialog. Educating people to facilitate communities, organizations, business, and individuals to emerge from the trauma of crisis to becoming self-reliant, self-organizing, innovative and resilient are the building blocks of true democracy. <br /><br />People often resist or ignore the effects of crisis or the need for transition until it becomes a no choice choice. They can become either helpless, a hindrance or helpful. Prepared facilitators, leaders, managers and citizens can guide the changes to move beyond crisis to becoming self-reliant and whole. <br /><br />To guide the process it's helpful to:<br /><br />• Know where you are: <br />Recognize the characteristics and objectives of each of the stages of transition from crisis to resilience.<br /><br />• Know who you're dealing with: <br />Identify psychological, social and behavioral profiles of the participants.<br /><br />• Know what to do: <br />Learn the interventions and facilitation strategies that are most effective to meet needs.<br /><br />• Know what NOT to do: <br />Avoid unintended consequences and misunderstandings and shift ineffective strategies.<br /><br />• Know when to move on: <br />Learn the factors that signal optimal time to transition.<br /><br />Being the Most Effective Together<br /><br />This framework can be used to map a whole system of the many processes and tools presented in this forum and beyond-- across four stages indicating when they can achieve optimal effectiveness. For example; Visual Recording would be very effective in Stage 1- Crisis, to make very clear, large visual aids for quick comprehension, and in Stage 2 - coordinating basic security for mapping services. Processes that create a context for dialog and deliberation could be used when people are in Stage 3 & 4- as they are ready to participate in groups. <br /><br />This is from my experience as a facilitator and organizational development professional. <br /><br />For more information http://crisis2resilience.com, feel free to contact me. Hina Pendle, PhD, Hina@uspartners.com<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It's a big leap to Open Government from where we are now. We can increase the capacity of facilitators, government and community leaders to be prepared to engage the public on many different levels beginning with crisis and ending with fully engaged resilient community.</div><br />	hina	14	17	3	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3757-4049

3762-4049	Regaining Greatness and Respect	2009-05-27 00:00:00	The Israeli occupation has passed all legal and moral limits. The colonization is accelerating and the Palestinians punished ever more cruelly -- the more or less sane part of the US establishment can see that Israel's expansion project will inevitably lead to the loss of US control of the Arab nations.<br /><br />I am sorry for both Clinton and Obama. These folks can't do anything. The Zionists have full control of both houses of congress and of American media, not to mention the banks and America's money. Anything beyond a little posturing would be political suicide. <br /><br />We're talking about across the board control, here. Open one of your children's textbooks. Look at the names of the people who wrote it and published it. Read the credits after a movie. Look up the 100 most powerful Americans. Look how all successful American politicians have had to prostrate themselves in front of AIPAC. That's not healthy. Not at all. Read the names on Obama's cabinet, etc, etc... Why is it that 3% of the population is controlling 97% of the population? Is that democratic? No, the majority rules in a democracy! How long has it been since the US has been a democracy?<br /><br />Nothing will change until the American people take back their media and their money. Outlaw all lobbyist organizations like AIPAC. Set up an election fund so that politicians will get elected to office without owing allegiance to corporations or individuals, but to the American people, only. Big, gigantic changes are need if America is to regain the greatness and respect that it had in the past. Prosecutions will be necessary as well.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The majority needs to rule in the United States of America, not only 3% of the population.

3769-4049	Shed Sunlight on USPTO's Practices Regarding Transparency	2009-05-27 00:00:00	I'm writing in my personal capacity, and not in my capacity as a patent examiner. This applies to whereever I've posted. I recommend that sunlight and open government will be shed on agencies, such as the US Patent & Trademark Office's efforts to encourage or hamper transparency regarding their patent operations. For example, this email was uncovered through FOIA which shows that a manager ordered destruction of documents regarding the 2nd pair of eyes program - which was a contentious program among patent examiners and patent applicants. These documents would have been crucial to fostering transparency regarding patent operations. It is recommended that emails such as this one at this link below can be posted on governmental websites to monitor agencies' efforts at being transparent.<br />www.ipscientificintegritywatch.info/uploads/removallistskisliuk.pdf<br /><br />I appreciate President Obama's Open Government Dialogue and hope that his administration's efforts will lead to greater transparency at the USPTO.<br /><br />I also recommend that more emails between managers and policy documents about the USPTO's Office of Patent Quality Assurance will be posted for the public to see as long as the privacy of patent examiners is not unduly exposed -from my reading, Inventors and Practictioners have stated on IP Blogs that they are interested in seeing such records - it would help them in understanding the examination process and why their patent application was rejected in a certain way - it would also add more transparency to the Internal Quality Review Review process at the USPTO and help to ensure that so-called "Quality Review Processes" are not used for antimeritocratic purposes, resulting too often - in "sham quality review". Members of the Public including leading members of the IP Community who contributed to a US Chamber of Commerce Report Recommmendations to the Incoming Administration on the USPTO - noted that the public has expressed skepticism in whether or not the USPTO's Quality Metrics actually accurately measures "quality". The report also noted that the 2nd pair of eyes program made examiners make "unjustified" decisions.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Greater Transparency and accountability would be added regarding the iniatiative to foster greater transparency in Governmental Agencies. Also greater transparency would be added to the so-called "Quality Review Process" at the USPTO.</div><br />	Patent Examiner	10	10	0	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3769-4049

Public financing would take that element out of the public process and make officials more accountable to the public at large. Maine and Arizona already have public financing and it has worked very well.<br /><br />All corporate lobbying should be prohibited on a similar principle of financing by the wealthiest coroporations and industries. Politcal votes then represent those corporate interests rather than the broader public. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Without these two elements, we'll never get elected officials who will represent the general public.

With a growing population and developing technology capital should increase accordingly. <br /><br />But investment for profit doesn't work that way. The real wealth that is created for use, consumer goods and capital goods used for production, does not have the volatility of the investment-for-profit market. We are all both consumers and investors. Our savings, of wealth we will need in the future, is entrusted to banks and investment funds that are driven by the profit motive, using other people's money.<br /><br />Wealth that is skimmed from the consumer economy into the investment market bids up the price of existing capital investment according to the prospect of profit from owning that equity, instead of investing in new capital. And then the rising stock price demands a higher rate of profit over production, to maintain a competitive rate of profit over investment. Thus the whole economy competes with the most profitable, and least legitimate, businesses for access to investment capital. War production, usurious lending, speculative investment, monopoly markets, Ponzi schemes, and political manipulation to plunder public resources drive the profit rate throughout the economy.<br /><br />But that's a dead-end street. The private profit at any price fanatics drive a bubble of real wealth, taken from the consumer economy by people who need to save for the future and by capitalists who drive wages down, into investments that have value only from the prospect of profit at an unsustainable rate. When the low wage economy can't support the going rate of profit from loans and retail sales the whole economy stalls out. Resale value of foreclosed property drops and the bubble bursts; the profiteers grab what they can of existing wealth and run. Plants are closed and workers are unemployed because their products can't be sold for the expected profit. The federal "bailout" subsidy is used, at best, to continue an unworkable system, and at worst to pay off a few profiteers and eliminate competitors.<br /><br />When value that is created for use is priced out of reach of consumers because of unemployment and low wages, and a profit margin demanded by the investment market, the whole economy stalls and investments for profit are worthless. Insiders and profiteers who know what's coming can grab and get out but people who need their savings for future use are left with nothing. Government regulation of financial institutions, and bankruptcy laws, have been aimed at protecting investors against cheating by other profiteers, but we need the regulators to manage the economic system so that it is sustainable for everyone's benefit.<br /><br />The "expanding economy" measured by stock market prices is not a measure of the consumer economy, but only of the effectiveness of skimming wealth out of that economy. The idea is used to justify profit as a virtue but real expansion is limited by the realities of ecology and resources and population density. The real virtue is sustainability and profit should be regulated for that purpose.<br /><br />We must wean ourselves away from the private-profit-at-any-price propaganda and recognize the value of public services like education and health care. Since Ben Franklin we don't expect the owner whose house is on fire to pay for the fire brigade, likewise people disabled by sickness should not have to pay to get well. Those are services we all might need, well equipped as only a public service can be. We need to appreciate the value of capital invested in not-for-profit applications and public services that are available to everyone. Also consumer- and employee-owned businesses that exist for purposes other than profit.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>We must build public awareness from the bottom up to support real change!<br /><br />The time is now, and the technology is here, to make that possible!</div><br />	glens	14	15	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3775-4049

3786-4049	Time to update the Freedom of Information Act	2009-05-28 00:00:00	The government's own statistics and various studies from the National Security Archive and others have shown the massive delays in processing FOIA requests. Drafting and application of FOIA exemption claims and classification policy has been demonstrated to depend too heavily on the attitude of the particular administration towards openness. Governments frequently confuse what they perceive to be the interest of the administration with that of the public interest. The purposes and objectives of the FOIA are unclear, and the law fails to define measurable outcomes for openness, accountability and pre-decisional participation by the public in the policy-making process.<br /><br />Experience around the world teaches us that government commitments to strengthen openness tend to be once in a generation opportunities to achieve - and embed - positive change. Changes to policy alone are meaningless if they are not supported by embedding changes within the law, as the next administration can alter policy far more easily than law (cf Att. Gen. Reno's FOIA memorandum vs. that from Att. Gen. Ashcroft).<br /><br />It is therefore time for a root and branch re-write of the FOIA.<br /><br />First, the law should contain a 'purposes' clause which sets out the aims of the law, and which agencies receiving requests and the mechanism to enforce the law must have regard when determining how to respond to requests. These should encapsulate the outcomes desired from the law, and other sections of the law should mandate the collection of such data as will facilitate the measurement of whether the outcomes are being achieved.<br /><br />A good example of a purposes clause can be found in section 4 of the New Zealand Official Information Act 1982<br />(http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/DLM65364.html)<br /><br />Purposes<br />The purposes of this Act are, consistently with the principle of the Executive Government's responsibility to Parliament,--<br /> (a) To increase progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand in order--<br /> (i) To enable their more effective participation in the making and administration of laws and policies; and<br /> (ii) To promote the accountability of Ministers of the Crown and officials,--<br />and thereby to enhance respect for the law and to promote the good government of New Zealand:<br /> (b) To provide for proper access by each person to official information relating to that person:<br /> (c) To protect official information to the extent consistent with the public interest and the preservation of personal privacy.<br /><br />Second, the classification of a document for security purposes must be immaterial when taking a decision on whether it should be disclosed in response to a FOIA request. The Act itself should set out the sole grounds for justifiable withholding, in terms of specific harms to particular interests. There should be no scope for information to be withheld simply because it falls within a particular category: each exemption from the right of access should be subject to a test of harm. In the event that disclosure would, or would be likely, to cause harm to one of those interests, withholding should still only be permitted if the public interest in maintaing the claim for exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure. The FOIA must override all other provisions in other statutes that provide for secrecy. It must also override secrecy provisions in international treaties, the bilateral 'security of information' treaties negotiated by the USA included. The FOIA should be the paramount legal instrument for arbitrating claims to secrecy and openness. <br /><br />Third, the law must set out those categories of information which each agency is affirmatively mandated to publish. The Mexican federal FOI law provides a good example of 17 key categories of information, including all government contracts, research grants etc. However, this approach can be too static in the long run, as the shape and nature of government evolves. The UK FOIA approach of 'publication schemes', which are documents setting out the categories of information each authority will publish either proactively, or on request without further consideration of exemptions, is also worth adding to the affirmatory categories. 'Publication schemes' must be approved by the law's enforcement mechanism, thereby providing for flexibility and for the level of openness to be ratcheted upwards over time. (see s.19 of the UK FOIA http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000036_en_2#pt1-pb4)<br /><br />This is the area of an FOI law most open to interface with provisions for agencies actively making available for scrutiny and re-use the datasets of information that they hold. Making them available in accordance with this provision of the FOIA provides the enforcement mechanism with a role in underpinning the Open Data initiative taken by this administration.<br /><br />Fourth, the primary mechansim for adjudication of claims under the FOIA should no longer be the courts. The experience since 1966, and in other countries where claims are resolved in the courts shows that this, to put it bluntly, a broken mechanism if one is to faciliate the participatory goals of a FOIA. This was recognised in the FOIA Amendment Act promoted by Senators Cornyn and Leahy which created the office of a pseudo-Ombudsman in the National Archives and Records Administration. Although it was along the right lines, it was flawed. Instead, a Federal Information Commission should be created to receive complaints regarding non-compliance with the FOIA. It should have the duty to investigate those complaints, the power to compel agencies to supply it with the information it needs to do so, and to take evidence on oath if necessary, and to order partial or full disclosure of the information requested. It should have the duty to approve or reject agencies' 'publication schemes', depending on whether they will result in desired levels of proactive disclosure. It should have the duty to promote awareness of the Act and to deliver training, both to government officials and to the public. It should have duties to collect data which will demonstrate whether the desired outcomes of the FOIA are being achieved. It should have the duty to report annually to Congress, and to have the power to conduct 'own motion' (sui generis) investigations into systemic failings on the part of agencies to comply with or provide high standards of administration of the FOIA. The Commisson should be mandated to collaborate with NARA to improve standards of record-keeping and information management in government. It should also be empowered to collaborate with the GAO and other oversight and integrity institutions where this would drive up standards of governance, accountability and integrity. In particular the Commission should be mandated to pay particular attention to the issue of ensuring that requests for information needed by the public (or their proxies such as NGOs) to participate in the policy making and service design process are expedited. It is too easy for agencies and enforcement bodies to pay more attention to post-decisional accountability issues than to pre-decisional participation. To this end, the government should consider the desirability of placing time-limits within the FOIA for resolution of complaints about non-disclosure of requested information, and recognise that the Commission will need to be resourced appropriately in order to do so.<br /><br />The Commission should have the power to instigate proceedings for contempt of court if its orders for supply of information or disclosure are not complied with.<br /><br />Appeals against the decisions of the Information Commission to the Appeals and Supreme Court should be permitted by both the request and the agency, both on a point of law and on the merits. However, if the agency appeals, it should fund the legal representation of the requester, to ensure 'equality of arms' before the Court.<br /><br />In conclusion, the US FOIA has proved a valuable but flawed tool to assist open government. But considerable experience, both in the US and overseas, has demonstrated that the drafting of the law is no longer fit for purpose and has fallen behind the lessons learnt by others. There are many benefits to be gained from overhauling the statutory guarantees of citizens' rights to information, and the current opportunity should be seized firmly.<br /><br />I'd be happy to provide more detail upon request.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This is important because people's right to information should be underpinned and governed by a law which is fit for purpose. The operation of the FOIA is demonstrably flawed and this cannot be separated from its outdated drafting. It needs fundamental improvement, not just tinkering around the edges. The USA should not be too proud to learn from others' experience on this issue.</div><br />	Andrew	30	31	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3786-4049

Lacking a commonly used name, civic intelligence, though it already exists as a phenomenon, will not receive the attention it deserves. Civic intelligence in a general way measures how well a community, nation, or society responds. <br /><br />Civic intelligence can be intentionally cultivated. What makes some societies smart? Why do some societies respond intelligently to shared challenges and some do not? What is the role of educational institutions, government, the media, etc.? Civic intelligence simply the next generation of democratic practice: Democracy as a way of promoting the collective thoughts and actions of citizens.<br /><br />Civic intelligence is more of a theme than a precise recommendation. It represents a way to describe both how societies come to make decisions now but an idealized way to make better decisions in the future. <br /><br />For more information, see the Civic Intelligence pattern (http://www.publicsphereproject.org/patterns/pattern.pl/public?pattern_id=1) from the Liberating Voices pattern language project (http://www.publicsphereproject.org/patterns/), an online collaborative effort to build a "pattern language" for bottom-up citizen-led information and communication initiatives.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Given the complex and potentially catastrophic nature of 21st Century challenges, the explicit consideration and cultivation of civic intelligence is more important than ever. These challenges will not be solved by a small group of very powerful, rich, or smart people; they will only be solved if the combined talents and resources of millions of people are directed towards them. </div><br />	douglas	13	16	3	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3787-4049

3793-4049	We Need A Completely New Tax Code	2009-05-28 00:00:00	The tax system we have now is so convoluted it encourages non-compliance. Consider a grossly simplified tax system that will make taxes easy and automatic for the bulk of Americans. Specific suggestions:<br /><br />[Note: I am not suggesting doing away with graduated income tax. I am suggesting making the tax flat for *most* and leave the complex tax system for just the high wage earners, who can afford expensive CPAs.]<br /><br />VAT to tax consumption -- Implement a broad-based Value Added Tax. This tax would apply to virtually all transactions: goods, services, rents, interest, wages. The idea of a VAT is that at every stage of the production of goods and services a tax is applied. The seller collects the tax, then deducts the total tax that they have paid to others to produce the product or service. The net effect is that an incremental tax is applied at every stage. This can replace sales taxes, revenue taxes, and miscellaneous excise taxes (as different types of items might have different VAT rates). The tax percentage could be relatively small (5%?) but distributed over the entire economy. No longer would big corporations rake in billions and not pay any tax, since the government would get a bit of every bit of revenue. This taxes consumption and eliminates all loopholes, creating a fair and simple system.<br /><br />Notice that I suggested that VAR apply to wages. This could serve as a low level "flat income tax." On top of this, the existing tax system (hopefully very simplified) could be applied but only to incomes above a certain threshold. Ideally this would be designed so that 60-80% of Americans would not even have to file a tax return, as the "high income tax" would apply only to the highest earners.<br /><br />Congress would then be able to manipulate several variables to control total revenue collected and how it is allocated:<br />VAR rate for different goods, services, wages, etc.<br />What threshold high-earner income tax would kick in<br />What the levels and percentages of the high-earner income tax would be<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Simplification of the tax system would increase compliance.<br /><br />Treating wages and services the same in terms of taxation would eliminate debates of independent contractors vs. employees<br /><br />Accounting trickery would not enable the degree of tax avoidance as today<br /><br /></div><br />	Peter Jackson	9	14	5	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3793-4049

3797-4049	Simplify Income Taxes	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Much of the complexity of our tax system comes from efforts over the years to make it more fair by closing loopholes. But it has become so complex that compliance, even for everyday people and small businesses, is incredibly expensive. Not only is this a waste of resouces, but in the end if encourages otherwise honest people not to comply.<br /><br />Some ideas to make income taxes easier:<br /><br />1. Setup the tax rates so that a very high percentage of Americans effectively pay a flat tax. The increasing tax rates, which shift the burden to those who can afford it, could come into play only for the highest earners. This would simplify withholding and computation of taxes for most--just withhold/pay the base rate. The high earners are responsible to compute and pay estimated taxes. Easier for employers. Could be applied to interest, dividends, Vegas winnings, independent contractors, etc.<br /><br />2. Much complexity for small businesses comes from deducting expenses from revenues to reach net income, which is taxed. Give small businesses the option of a "standard expense rate". For instance, a small business could compute taxable income from:<br /> Revenue - Cost of Goods - Wages paid = Income before Expenses<br /> Income before Expenses * IRS Expense Factor = Income for taxes<br />No more saving receipts or explaining to the IRS why your computer is for business use instead of personal use. Of course, if your expenses exceed the IRS factor, you should be able to deduct actual instead...but expect to be audited! The IRS factor could be standard, or might be based on the type of business.<br /><br />3. Make gifts and inheritances subject to income tax! Why do we tax the payor instead of the payee on these? They are certainly income. A couple of things to make that more bearable:<br /> - each person can inherit up to $xxx from any person untaxed (in their lifetime). i.e., I get that much free from mom, and I get that much free from dad and their maid gets that much free from my mom and s/he gets that much free from my dad.<br /> - each person can receive up to $yyy per year in gifts untaxed.<br /> - you can always average your income back 5 years to reduce tax on spikes <br /><br /><br />4. Rather than having special rates for certain income, with bizzare phaseouts, etc, have simplier to apply formulas. For instance:<br /><br /> - capital gains: every person can exclude x% of capital gain income, up to $y total. I.e., you can deduct 50% of your cap gain income, up to $10,000. You could have similar formulas for interest, dividends, or anything else.<br /> - to help simplify reporting, have an exclusion for a certain amount of miscellaneous unreported income. If you just said, look, up to $2000 of otherwise unreported income is OK not to report and pay tax on.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>A simplified tax code will reduce compliance cost and burden and dramatically increase compliance.</div><br />	Peter Jackson	19	24	5	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3797-4049	
3799-4049	Where Is The Outrage?	2009-05-28 00:00:00	<br /><br /><br />For centuries, fundamental economic market-place requirements have been few and simple: 1) a meeting of the minds, 2) between competent, buyers and sellers, 3) acting in good faith. Even today's global market is a seamless extension of each nation's electronic apparatus, patched together to accommodate billions of individual, arm-length's business transactions conducted at light-speed. Yet, regardless of the complexity and sophistication of a modern markets' electronic framework, it performs a function similar to those during the Greek and Roman empires. The basic premise that enabled markets to flourish then is the same now - - trust. <br />Our current state of global economics mimics the medieval plague in its rapid and relentless spreading of pain and panic around the planet. However, unlike the plague, our present dilemma was not an accident nor was it caused by mistake and until those responsible publicly acknowledge it, the undeniable fact remains: Whoever conceived and orchestrated this perfidy are social psychopaths masquerading as gifted and talented human beings.<br />Social psychopathic behavior was exhibited in this instance, by amoral individuals who chose to disregard the series of damaging events their fraudulent actions set in motion. Thus, solely to possess extraordinary wealth and privilege, and without regard for dire consequences, these social psychopaths created an economic perfect storm for the rest of us to face without an umbrella or "parachute" as the case may be.<br />The corresponding enormous suffering they were willing to unleash upon the world has spread like a California wild fire. Unthinkably, the credibility of American integrity or trust is under siege. Trust may be a legal concept to some few, others view it as a commodity . . . and still others compare it to virginity and nations like individuals either are to be trusted or not. Trust is on trial. And the lack of trust in markets, economic systems, currencies, governance, leadership, and more - - all combined are at stake, here and now. <br />At home and abroad, perception of Wall Street's superior financial acumen and trust in our market system is drifting unsettlingly close to despair. Thus far, leadership's inability to effectively respond to system failure may very well have damaged the public's full faith and confidence so irrevocably, nothing less than strict accountability for the consequences of omitted and committed acts will suffice to atone for the direct and collateral damage sustained. No responsible party could allow that perception to continue. <br />This planet's world-economy shall continue to stagger until the leadership acknowledges the obvious: Without trust among all parties, i.e., brokers, buyers, and sellers - - the existing, worldwide market framework shall remain in critical condition. It will remain jeopardy until the culprits, collectively responsible for precipitating the collapse, stand trial. Restoring public trust in purportedly free enterprise systems may well hinge upon a credible response to such blatantly, reprehensible actions. One may disagree, but first allow me explain why, I believe, this is necessary for our economic survival, even at the risk of system implosion.<br />One cannot help but wonder at the lack of public outrage over a world driven to economic devastation and then pushed over the edge into the abyss by those in whom stewardship of our nation's financial system was entrusted. In fact, I have read local newspaper accounts of a theft involving three cases of beer more vigorously prosecuted! The "average American" or "silent majority" or call us what-ever-you-choose-to-call-us, we have been betrayed. Whether it was our grandparents' life savings or our inheritance from loving parents' or funds invested to finance philanthropy and worker pensions was irrelevant to these swindlers. Where is the outrage?<br />The accumulated savings of millions of families around the world was merely another pile of capital to prostitute and pillage. Yet it was so easy . . . like stealing candy from a blind baby. Arguably, the ugly truth insinuates that self-styled elites (wealth equals privilege) have regarded Rule of Law and America's criminal justice system as another caste system toy. <br />Only the naive might be astounded (or not) to discover that we were betrayed "by the best money could buy." They are graduates of America's best colleges and universities who have risen to public and private offices of authority, who belong to our nation's most exclusive clubs, who did not tolerate others questioning their judgment, and who expect no one would dare challenge their actions. Most of us outside that culture-club might reasonably have expected the price required to earn membership into such a life style was market-driven; and thus, appropriately based on one's merit. After all, to entrust fiduciary duties involving trillions of leveraged Dollars, Yen, Yuan, Pounds, and Euros, to anyone less than those, who by virtue of their merits, possessed outstanding character, superior intellect, excellent judgment, and impeccable references would be unthinkable. No reasonably prudent human being would dare presume to do otherwise. Yeah, Right.<br />Too late, we now comprehend that whoever authorized handing over the reins of such awesome power are as culpable as those who pulled the trigger. However, even at this late point, it is necessary and proper to acknowledge the obvious - - society's gatekeepers (public/private entities with authority to make appointments/hire) not only lacked common sense to an inordinate degree, but also possessed an uncanny ability to mistake social psychopaths as human beings possessed of sound judgment and good character.<br />Think about it. When the deceitful, major players' responsible either by omission or commission of our financial, banking dilemma remain in virtual control of that financial, banking system - - whom should they trust? Actually, they would trust all others to behave exactly as they do; and consequently, no one can trust anyone else.<br />Having thus utterly destroyed trust in our markets, those responsible also realize what others among us already suspect: Government stimulus efforts are a futile attempt to buy more time . . . more time for the culpable to cover their tracks . . . more time for establishing alibis . . . more time for witnesses to $forget$ (or disappear) . . .and more time for shredding evidence. Thus, I fail to see how a bank stress test or more bailout or TARP or stimulus is even remotely relevant to resolve the fundamental issue necessary to avoid the threat of further financial deterioration, i.e., instability. <br />More intriguing, why would any responsible government ask a reasonably, prudent populace to continue to place trust in those same financial management executives and boards, who aided, abetted, and did in fact perpetrate catastrophic fraud? It begs the question: Why do these same power brokers, whose greed pushed us over the edge into instability, remain in those lofty, well-paid positions? More to the point, why are they still holding positions of authority critical to this nation's recovery instead of facing charges for treason? Thus far, their treason has come closer to accomplishing what the1990s North Korean government Super Note Conspiracy intended, but failed to do - - and that is to overthrow the United States by destruction of our nation's sovereign economy.<br />It is absurd to assert that those responsible for creating and passing massive amounts of fraudulently-rated, worthless paper over the entire globe (CDOs), while simultaneously selling billions worth of insurance without assets to cover (credit swaps) are not responsible for the consequences of their actions. They were aware, before the fact, that their actions would precipitate an immense default. Otherwise, why was there a need to collude with rating agencies to lie? Consequently, in addition to treason, their actions demand felony charges as well as civil liabilities. <br />By any standards, the U.S. Treasury's October 2008, bank bailout proposal was foolish from inception and quickly grew even worse. A plan that offered the very authors of deceit a blank check book is obscene. For Treasury, to claim later with a straight face, "They (corporations' Wall Street executive-types and their Board of Directors) are indispensable to this nation's economic recovery" is beyond absurd. How dare anyone spin such nonsense through those that carry their water! There is no excuse for the U.S. Attorney General to delay an investigation. A greed so pervasive and made even more insidious because it was a fraud that purported to be the semblance of a regulated, orderly market.<br />Finally, if calling for an investigation in order to establish criminal culpability can be bizarrely construed as playing some kind of blame game, the even before market-place trust was destroyed, the Constitution of the United States became irrelevant. If no one is guilty of this severe harm done, then no one can be truly innocent ever again, can they? It is sort of like head's they win, tail's we lose. And since when did Americans buy into that malarkey?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Even at this late point, it is necessary and proper to acknowledge the obvious - - society's gatekeepers (public/private entities with authority to make appointments/hire) not only lacked common sense to an inordinate degree, but also possessed an uncanny ability to mistake social psychopaths as human beings possessed of sound judgment and good character.<br /><br />Think about it.</div><br />	educare	17	19	2	7	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3799-4049	
3800-4049	Combine Tax Systems	2009-05-28 00:00:00	The US tax system is composed of so many different taxes: FICA, Income Tax, Medicare, cigarette, gasoline, unemployment, AMT, etc. I'm sure that just scratches the surface.<br /><br />The reason why we have so many taxes is that everytime Congress creates a new program, they have to create a tax to pay for it.<br /><br />Simplify! Develop a small number of taxes. Income, Sales, VAT, whatever. Then adjust the rates on those taxes to pay for the programs.<br /><br />The current litany of taxes on payroll are a huge problem. An employer is faced with so many reporting and withholding requirements that they are reticent to hire employees. They also end up being regressive instead of progressive.<br /><br />The combination of a tax on consumption (preferably on both goods and services) plus a much simplified income tax should be designed to generate the needed income.<br /><br />The only payroll tax, other than income, should be an employer paid tax that is based on what benefits the employer provides. The theory being, if the employer does not provide the benefit, then the government will have to. The employer could pay a tax that ranges, say from 0-10%. Offer health insurance, pay less tax. Pay a living wage, pay a lower payroll tax. Employ people only part time with no benefits, pay more tax.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The system we have now is too complex. There are too many different taxes for different things. Payroll taxes discourage hiring.</div><br />	Peter Jackson	20	25	5	6	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3800-4049	
3802-4049	Combine retirement account systems and make them automatic	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Every employee in the country should automatically get set up with an IRA. Employers would be required to open an account if the new employee does not already have one. But if the employee does have one, the employer would direct money into that existing account.<br /><br />A percentage of every employee's pay should automatically go into that IRA. From the first dollar we earn as teenagers, we should be forced to set aside a small percentage. We should have the option, like with a 401k, to say we want more to go into the account. The employer should have the option to match. And, like a traditional IRA, the employee should be able to put a certain amount of other money into it.<br /><br />The key points: every employee must put at least, say, 2% of every paycheck into the account through their entire lives, and this is their one retirement account that they can use for everything. This would combine the IRA, 401(k), SIMPLE IRA, SEP IRA, etc.<br /><br />If the employee wanted to have more than one IRA, they could. But their one account could also serve to hold money from all these different sources.<br /><br />Maybe they would have two, one for pre-tax dollars and one for after-tax dollars (like a ROTH IRA).<br /><br />This gives every employee a nest egg to watch grow. Easy options should be available (like in 401ks) and investments in things like "target funds" should be encouraged.<br /><br />This is not meant to replace Social Security, it is meant to supplement it and to simplify the current dizzying array of IRA/retirement plan options and force everyone to do a bit to save.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Force people to save at least a bit for retirement and simplify the whole process.</div><br />	Peter Jackson	-1	17	18	7	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3802-4049	
3803-4049	Code of ethics for secrecy classification	2009-05-28 00:00:00	A public code of ethics with regard to classifying government data or actions as secret should be developed. Acceptable instances of such classification should be defined as specifically as possible (e.g., "to preserve national security" is too general). Then review of the classification of specific data as secret by other government classifiers should always be done in order to ensure that the ethics code is upheld. Secret actions or data that might be considered as violating civil rights or liberties should receive extra review and consideration before being approved. One goal of the ethics code should be to minimize data that is classified as secret.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>A government allowed to operate in secret can too easily become corrupt, self-serving, and not operating for the best interests of its citizens. "To preserve national security" is not a good enough reason because it attempts to predict effects on future happenings of certain actions or data being known or not known. Normally there are too many variables, including variations in human nature, for any confidence in such predictions. Perhaps there is nothing better for our national security than confidence that our government is being open and truthful and protective of freedom and civil rights for all people.</div><br />	vfdean	39	41	2	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3803-4049	
3804-4049	Make Higher Education Available to All With Imaginative Ways to Pay	2009-05-28 00:00:00	The future of this country depends on our ability to educate our people. Higher education should no longer be available just to the rich. Everyone should be able to go. Right now the only beneficiaries of student loans are banks.<br /><br />One approach would be to improve/expand programs that offer to pay for college in exchange for public service, either before or after. Army, Navy, etc. But also Peace Corps, Ameri Corps, or sevice with organizations after you have obtained your degree. Maybe even give credit for service to volunteer organizations, etc.<br /><br />For this to work, the amount of government contribution should be far more substantial than it is now. College can easily cost $30k, $50k, $100k, but I think government programs cap out at something like $5k a year. <br /><br />How about a program where the government will pay for your education and in exchange you agree to pay an extra x% on your income taxes for some period of time. <br /><br />For instance, maybe get a Harvard Law degree on the government's dime, and pay 3% more in income taxes every year for the rest of your life. Sounds like a great deal for both the government and the student!<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Education is our future. Right now getting a degree, especially an advanced degree requires either a rich family or debilitating student loans.</div><br />	Peter Jackson	53	64	11	15	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3804-4049

Initially maybe many things are allowed to stay classified. But as that classified information gets older and older, it should be harder and harder for the government to keep it classified.<br /><br />We are learning much from recent releases of info from the Kennedy administration. But President Bush changed the rules when he entered office. Will all the details of his administration ever be known?<br /><br />Is there really a national interest in keeping things classified/private 20, 30, 40, 50 years down the line?<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>If the people in government know that eventually their decisions will be made public (even if it is to their grand kids), those people will take care to assure their actions will stand up to public scrutiny.</div><br />	Peter Jackson	19	23	4	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3805-4049	
3806-4049	Principles Governing 21st Century Citizen Participation	2009-05-28 00:00:00	<br /><br />Besides brainstorming particular ideas for advancing democracy, it's also important to develop some overarching democratic principles. Such principles can help ensure that the totality of new ideas advance basic democratic norms and ideals. <br /><br />Here are examples of five such democratic principles:<br /><br />(1) The Participatory Ideal<br /><br />In a healthy democracy, all people should:<br /><br />â&euro;&oelig;govern themselves in at least some public matters at least some of the time . . . . Active citizens govern themselves directly . . . , not necessarily . . . in every instance, but frequently enough and in particular when basic policies are being decided and when significant power is being deployed.â&euro;? (Benjamin Barber, "Strong Democracy," pp. xiv, 151)<br /><br /><br />(2) Minority Representation<br /><br />On issues in which individuals choose not to participate, they should know that others with a similar point of view are participating competently, in effect on their behalf. This entails, among other things, mechanisms to ensure that the views of socially disadvantaged groups are fully represented and that their needs and rights are respected.<br /><br /><br />(3) Level Playing Field<br /><br />Broadened and equalized opportunities for participation must be supported by relatively equal access to resources required for efficacy, including time and money. Today, for example, politicians, government functionaries, soldiers, and jurors are paid to perform their civic duties. Why not, when necessary, pay citizens to perform theirs? Fairness and equality may also be served by increasing the ratio of representatives chosen by lot to those chosen by vote. <br /><br /><br />(4) Deliberative Democracy<br /><br />20th Century American democracy emphasized: (a) periodic voting for leaders; and (b) representation of self-organized stakeholder groups (i.e., interest-group pluralism). 21st Century democracy needs to complement those 20th Century processes with deliberative processes that represent the vast majority of people whose views, concerns and life-experiences who are not well-represented by the collectivity of organized stakeholder groups that are active on any given issue.<br /><br /><br />(5) Democratic Research and Finance<br /><br />The government and or private philanthropy need to ensure that adequate resources are available to support research, development, demonstration, evaluation, and deployment of promising and effective democratic practices . . . locally, nationally and transnationally.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Such principles are important in order to step back from particular favorite ideas and ensure that the totality of new ideas fulfill basic democratic norms and ideals.</div><br />	richard	8	9	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3806-4049	
3808-4049	e-Liberate: Roberts Rules of Order for online, distributed meetings	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Roberts Rules of Order was designed over a 40 year period to allow people to convene democratic meetings where everybody was allowed to speak but the minority could not prevent the majority from making a decision. While many current systems allow discussion of many people, there are extremely few systems that encourage deliberation. Our system, developed by students at The Evergreen State College in collaboration with Douglas Schuler (douglas@publicsphereproject.org) who originally proposed it, is -- we think -- the first online system that uses Roberts Rules of Order. We now have versions running as part of the Public Sphere Project (http://www.publicsphereproject.org) and as part of the Milan Civic Network (Rete Civica di Milano) in Milan, Italy, and we are seeking governments and civil society organizations who are interested in working with the system.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Thousands of groups around the world use Roberts Rules of Order to allow them to have orderly meetings where decisions were made.

3811-4049	Put America and the World to Work	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Refine and the Execute Plan To Put America and the World to Work. A pdf version of this plan can be downloaded or read at http://www.wethepeoplenow.org/put_america_to_work.pdf or an HTML copy at http://www.wethepeoplenow.org/put_america_to_work.htm<br /><br />This plan outlines actions necessary to avoid a massive depression. These actions include:<br /><br /> 1. By the end of March 2009, create at least 20 million jobs in the U. S. and one billion jobs worldwide providing free single payer health care, affordable food, housing, fuel and public transportation, manufacturing, retooling factories, developing and fielding alternative energy sources, energy conservation measures, environmental protection and recycling, infrastructure repairs and construction, education and training, and mitigating the effects of climate change.<br /> 2. Provide funds for these jobs by repealing Wall Street and bank bailout legislation, nationalizing the Federal Reserve System and recouping as much as possible of the $12.8 trillion of taxpayers money that the Federal Reserve, U. S. Treasury and FDIC have provided or committed to financial institutions, ending the Iraq and Afghanistan wars/occupations, ending the so called war on terror, drastically reducing defense department and other wasteful government spending and with very progressive income/revenue and property taxes on individuals and corporations with very generous tax deductions/credits for worthwhile causes<br /> 3. Establish an improved Work Projects Administration (WPA) and "Civilian Conservation-Construction-Engineering-Medical-IT-Youth Corps to help coordinate/manage planning and the work.<br /> 4. Bring all troops home from overseas to help provide much of the leadership, training, logistics, financial and technical personnel for the new WPA and "civilian corps."<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>At the end of December 2009, 20 million Americans will be unemployed and at lease 13 million will only be able to find part time work based on the current monthly rates of increase in these two numbers.<br /><br />The $787 billion Stimulus Act is unlikely to create more than a half of a million jobs this year. It is too long, complicated, and very poorly organized. It has earmarks and many other items that do not contribute to creating jobs or providing assistance . It provides billions of dollars to health insurance companies over one third of which will go to overhead and profits and not to new jobs or actual healthcare. Please take a look at the table of contents.<br /> <br />A total of 20 million new jobs must be created as rapidly as possible and no later than the end December 2009. As many jobs as practicable must be saved. If the recession ends before this or if it worsens before the total is reached then these numbers can be readjusted.<br />Ramping up to 20 million new jobs, with average annual wages/salaries of $40,000.00 and 25% for overhead, energy and materials, by the end of the year, would cost about $375 billion, less than half of $787 billion Stimulus Act.<br />Jobs for a year for 20 million people with the same average annual salaries and overhead would cost one trillion dollars which is one twelfth of what has been provided or committed to prop up Wall Street and banks. <br />With decent jobs, people will be able to pay their mortgages (if interest rates are reasonable) and buy more goods. Companies will then be able to hire more people and produce and provide more goods and services. This will leverage the funds put into jobs and avert a depression.<br />These jobs should be in both the private and public sector and scattered throughout the country. A portion of the workers will be providing health care, child care and elderly care for others and manufacturing items that others will be installing. Other workers will be teaching, training, counseling, recycling materials, mining raw materials, generating energy, and food services and doing all the things that a community/country needs to do.<br />As these workers spend, millions of other jobs will be created.<br />Likewise, according to the CIA World Factbook, 30%, well over one billion, of the world's workforce are unemployed. Accordingly, one billion new jobs must be created as rapidly as possible and no later than the end December 2009. As many jobs as practicable must be saved. If the recession ends before this or if it worsens before the total is reached these numbers can be readjusted.<br />Ramping up to one billion new jobs, with average annual wages/salaries of $20,000.00 and 25% for overhead, energy and material by the end of the year, would cost about $10 trillion. <br />Jobs for a year for 20 billion people with the same average annual salaries and overhead would cost $25 trillion. </div><br />	dfpa	6	8	2	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3811-4049

States charter their own state-owned banks that issue low-interest credit on the fractional reserve model similar to the Bank of North Dakota (BND).<br />8. Break down large banks and financial institutions into community, city and at most state size banks/firms by invoking anti-trust laws. At the same time separate commercial/retail banking activities and investment activities into different institutions.<br />9.

Breakdown mortgage backed securities into individual mortgages and:<br /> a. Resolve any fraud or irregularities involved in the origination and trading of mortgages and related mortgage backed securities.<br /> b. Determine the actual current owners of the mortgages and the real properties covered by the mortgage, the amount owed on each mortgage based on new interest rates and late fees, the market value of the real property, whether or not the owner can afford the real property and available options, including in particular loan modifications that could reduce interest rates and eliminates onerous fees, ARMs, prepayment penalties, etc. <br /> c. Choose the best option(s) for the owner of the property and the owner of the mortgage.<br />13. Break down all other derivatives into individual "instruments (s)", e.g. promissary note(s) or contract(s), from which the derivative derived its value, in about the same way that mortgage back securities and individual mortgages were resolved. <br /> a. Resolve any fraud involved in the origination and trading of each instrument and the related derivative.<br /> b. Determine the actual owners of each instrument and the "real property(s)" associated with each instrument, determine the amount owed on each instrument based on new interest rates and late fees, the market value of each real property, whether or not the owner can afford the property and can and will make payments and available options.<br /> c. Chose the most appropriate option(s) for the owner of the real property and the owner of the instrument.<br />14. Resolve the banking crisis:<br /> a. Require that banks prepare accurate balance sheets which reflect actual values of all liabilities and assets including troubled assets and risky investments. Determine which banks are solvent or insolvent and by how much. <br /> b. Allow private owners of insolvent banks time to fully recapitalize, if they can. Do not spend any more taxpayers dollars to try to keep them in existence.<br /> c. Have the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) take over insolvent banks that cannot raise enough private capital. Re-privatize those banks quickly, by selling off their parts to healthier enterprises with commercial/retail activities and investment activities going into separate institutions separate institutions and breaking them down into community, city and no larger than state size banks/firms.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The finance industry has effectively captured our government. ... recovery will fail unless we break the financial oligarchy that is blocking essential reform. And if we are to prevent a true depression, we're running out of time. Simon Johnson<br />Trading derivatives which does nothing for the real economy, were rightfully outlawed until December 2000. On December 14, 2000, Senator Phil Gramm, supported by then Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, then Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, attached a 262 page amendment, that deregulated trading of derivatives and credit default swaps, to an omnibus appropriations bill. Gramm's amendment. The amendment was never debated by the House or Senate and by-passed the substantive policy committees in both the House and the Senate so that there were neither hearings nor opportunities for recorded committee votes. <br />This and other laws passed by Congress, unleashed the now worldwide derivatives market, paved the way for banks to become more aggressive about investing in mortgages, and opened the door to an explosion in new, unregulated wagers/securities. The amendment also contained a provision lobbied for by Enron, a generous contributor to Gramm that exempted energy trading from regulatory oversight, allowing Enron to run rampant, wreck the California electricity market, and cost consumers billions before it collapsed.<br />Our legislators, government executives and regulators blamed it on on a "few bad apples" and did nothing and are not planning to do anything constructive. <br />The unregulated trading of derivatives is arguably the primary cause of the current massive worldwide recession. <br />The Bank of International Settlements in Switzerland reports that the current notional (vague or general) value of derivatives held by the world's financial institutions is $1,140 trillion which is over 16 times the annual gross domestic product of the entire world. According to the Comptroller of the Currency, the books of U.S. banks now carry over $180 trillion of derivatives derivatives.Obviously, these derivatives are not worth nearly their book value and they in general become worth less and less each day<br />Derivatives are often called "toxic or troubled assets" if they are not worth as much as financial institution show that they are worth on their books. Since assets minus liabilities equals net worth, the actual value of the derivatives determines if the financial institution is solvent or not and whether or not the financial institution should be restructured or remain in business.<br />It is estimated that the actual value of derivatives in U. S. financial institutions are worth several hundred trillion dollars less than what their values is listed on the financial institutions' books. Obviously many of the largest banks are bankrupt and have been and are concealing this bankruptcy by listing these assets on their books at prices that are far above their market value. Current law and regulations requires that books show actual value of assets and liabilities and that insolvent financial institutions be seized and restructured.<br />Over the past 16 months or so the Federal Reserve and the U. S. Treasury provided or committed at least $12.8 trillion of taxpayers money to prop up selective financial institutions under the guise of getting them to increase lending. Lending has not increased and banks are charging exorbitant interest rates on the money that they are willing to lend. However, foreclosures on homes, unemployment, poverty, huger, the price of food and pension fund losses have increased.<br />The former Secretary of the Henry Paulson, Fed Chairman Bernake and the current Secretary of the Treasury Geithner's were instrumental in distributing the $12.8 trillion. They have done nothing to fix the real problems in the financial systems and have not announced which financial institutions are insolvent and by how much. Instead they used taxpayers money to buy stock in these institutions some of which are probably insolvent. They paid at least $78 billion more than the stock in financial institution that they bought was worth <br />The $12.8 trillion was provided in such a way that the U.S. Government and taxpayers have no say as to how the money was spent or over the management of institutions that they bought shares in or provided funds too. <br />It would have been infinitely better to have used this money for jobs and recovery.<br />Under their "new" plans to try to fix the financial system, Geithner and Bernanke are unwisely and illegally, giving hundreds of billions of dollars more to financial institutions and draining more resources needed for jobs and other recovery efforts. <br />Geithner and Bernanke are allowing some of the banks to convert the preferred stock, that they and Secretary Paulson bought with taxpayers dollars, into common stock. This means that the banks will not have to pay the government dividends or buy back the stock in cash as they and Paulson had promised that the banks would do. At any point the common stock could become worthless. <br />Geithner and Bernanke are misleading the public under their so called new Consumer and Business Lending Initiative they will lend money to investors not to consumers or to businesses. According to the Treasury's Document: The Consumer and Business Lending Initiative the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will lend up to $200 billion to holders of eligible asset backed securities (ABS) with the ABSs as collateral . [An ABS is a derivative]. Eligible ABS includes newly issued securitizations backed by credit card loans, private and government-guaranteed student loans, and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration [none of these items are assets] and they can easily become worthless with the taxpayers will be left holding the bag. <br />Likewise under their "Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan" billions of more taxpayers' dollars will be given to banks. This will not work. It follows several other federal efforts to prevent foreclosures that have failed, including the Hope for Homeowners program, which was enacted last year.<br />Bernanke is also purchasing hundreds of billions of troubled mortgage-backed securities from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Buying troubled assets will slow down effort the effort to actually determine what they are worth and reward the business executives who caused the problems with taxpayers money.<br />There are several articles on the internet that show how Geitner's Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP) will transfer more taxpayer money to Wall Street. Basically, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will put up 87%, the Treasury 7% and a "private assets funds manager", such as Goldman Sachs, 7% of the funds to setup essentially a hedge fund to buy toxic assets. The private investor will have absolute control over the assets. Geithner has apparently already picked the firms that will bid against one another to run up the price of the toxic assets to close to full price, which are probably worth less than 30 cents on the dollar. The asset manager could buy the toxic assets at full price and then sell them later for 28 cents on the dollar to another investor. The firm is supposed to give half of the sales price, 14 cents or 14% to the government and retain the other 14%. Under this scenario the brokerage firm will double it's investment, the bank get over three times what the toxic asset are worth and the taxpayer will lose 86% of their investment. The FDIC falsely represented to Congress that they needed $500 billion to protect depositors but is using the $500 billion for the PPIP.<br />Neither Geithner or Bernake are saying that these new plans will actually remove all the toxic assets from the financial systems. There is simply no way that the financial systems in the U.S. or the world can be bailed out. The Fed and U.S. government must not provide any additional funds to banks or to Wall Street. This money is needed for jobs and other recovery efforts.<br />On April 2, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved changes to fair-value, or mark-to-market accounting rules approved by FASB on April 2 allow firms to use "significant" judgment in gauging prices of some investments on their books, including mortgage-backed securities. Banks will also be allowed to exclude from net income any losses they deem "temporary," making it easier to provide a flattering earnings picture, said Kersting at Edward Jones. <br />If just two or so of the $12.8 trillion wasted on investment bankers and stockbrokers had been spent on jobs, there would be no recession today.<br />Investing in jobs rather than enriching corporate executives, stock brokers, bankers, and mortgage lenders will restore prosperity to Main Street, Wall Street and all the side streets.<br /></div><br />	dfpa	11	11	0	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3813-4049

3819-4049	A simple method to ensure openness in governance	2009-05-28 00:00:00	The idea of an Open Government is laudable. However the basic reason why the present form of Democracy is not so open is that the political parties, which tend to prevent an individual elected representative from acting according to his/her conscience, have come to be accepted as inevitable for the process of elections and governance based on discussion. We need to devise an alternative to the concept of political parties. This is feasible provided we apply ourselves to it. <br /><br />A website can register all those who wish to serve as people's representatives in a particular constituency. If 100 people are willing to serve then they are divided into 33 triplets. Each member of a triplet then evaluates the other two members and chooses one out of them, ignoring himself/herself. The one getting 2 votes is chosen. From 100, 33 are chosen. From 33, 11 are chosen. This process is continued till one is declared elected.<br /><br />An representative elected on such a non-partisan basis can remain faithful to his conscience and the constituency he represents without having to fall in line with a partisan line of thinking.<br /><br />An elected house made up of such non-partisan representatives would definitely have people uppermost in their minds and ensure an Open Government.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The inevitable draw-backs of party-based governance including the huge expenditure involved during elections can be avoided.</div><br />	Vijayaraghavan Padmanabhan	4	6	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3819-4049

3822-4049	EFM Virtual Corps - State Department	2009-05-28 00:00:00	<br /><br />We have approximately 2,000 out of 9,000 family members who are currently working in over 217 missions worldwide. Majority if not all of them already have, at the minimum, a "Secret" level clearance. And yet, when they relocate to other posts, it is entirely possible that they won't find work there. The average cost to process a SECRET clearance has been reported to run from several hundred dollars to $3,000, depending on individual factors. The average cost to process a TOP SECRET clearance is between $3,000 and about $15,000, depending on individual factors. Given that most FS folks spend majority of their lives overseas, the $3,000 for a Secret clearance process for EFMs would be way too low. But let's assume that all the EFMs currently working only have a Secret level clearance - at $3,000 each that's still 6Million USD right there. Even if only 500 of them lost their jobs due to regular reassignment, that's 1.5M USD that's not put to effective use.<br /><br />So here's the idea - why can't we create an EFM Virtual Corps? The EFMs who are already in the system could be assigned a specialization based on prior work experience within the US Mission. When not employed at post, their names could be added to the EFM Virtual Corps, a resource for other posts who require virtual supplementary or temporary/ongoing support online. Their email and Intranet logon should be enabled to facilitate communication while they are on a float assignment and their reporting authority should be a straight line to a central coordinator at Main State and a dotted line to the Management Counselor at post. The technology is already available, we just need organizational will and some, to make this work.

3823-4049	Language Specialist Corps - State Department	2009-05-28 00:00:00	A GAO Report on Foreign Languages: Human Capital Approach Needed to Correct Staffing and Proficiency Shortfalls indicates that personnel with foreign language skills are needed in a range of federal agency programs and missions. It states in part:<br /><br /> "In light of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the importance of foreign language skills will increase as the United States expands its efforts to counter terrorist activities. The federal agencies we reviewed face shortages of translators and interpreters, as well as staff with other foreign language skills. These shortages strain agency operations that depend in part on language-skilled employees to meet increasingly complex missions. Agencies have pursued strategies such as training, targeted recruitment efforts, and contracting to fill documented skill gaps. However, these strategies have not been completely effective in closing those gaps."<br /><br />The State Department has an available pool of native language speakers within our ranks, but as usual, we did not see it fit to factor them in our strategic human capital planning. We have shortages of translators and interpreters in the Federal Government, why can't we put to use FS family members and partners with native foreign language proficiency? How many foreign born spouses do we have? How many native born spouses do we have who have already availed themselves of language training at FSI? More than I could count. Test them at FSI, keep them on the roster and reward them hiring points for keeping/improving language capabilities, put them on call as translators and foreign language specialist as needed by the Government. With a Language Specialist Corps composed of native speakers from the Foreign Service community, we would not only be filling up a documented skills gap in the Federal Government, we would also give our family members another option at creating a portable career at home and abroad. (Source: Diplopundit)<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Although the US Army make use of external resources including contracting staff as needed, recruiting native or U.S.-trained language speakers; or drawing on the expertise of other agency staff, reservists, or retirees, the State Department does not target native speakers, nor use external resources, because it does not believe that language proficiency is the primary criterion for selecting Foreign Service officers.

Sincerely apologize to the Iraqis for the economic sanctions, invasion, devastation, occupation, deaths, maiming, abuse and torture of Iraqis, the damage and destruction of Iraqi mosques, homes, facilities, historical treasures, etc., the attempted theft of Iraqi oil and oil profits, etc.<br /> 2. Order an immediate unilateral cease fire and halt all offensive and clandestine operations by coalition forces, the CIA, U.S. paid mercenaries, etc. Call on all factions in Iraq to please do the same.<br /> 3. Immediately return sovereignty, the control of all oil reserves and other resources to the people of Iraq, make amends, make restitution, reparations, and condolence payments for all the physical and emotional damages to Iraqi's and their country, treat Iraqi's as equals, by respecting the fundamental rights of Iraqis, etc.<br /> 4. Order an immediate withdrawal of CIA operatives and U.S. paid mercenaries<br /> 5.

3826-4049	Functional Fellowship for EFMs - State Department	2009-05-28 00:00:00	<br /><br />Most jobs (including State's specialist requirements) require candidates to have the skills and specialized experience of at least three years. Given that family members move every 2-3 years, and have no control over what jobs becomes available at any given post, an FS spouse would have to be extremely lucky if he/she can have that three years experience in one specific field in a span of three overseas assignments (6-9 years). In reality, that almost never happens because most spouses take whatever job becomes available -mail clerk, security escort, roving secretary, CLO, newsletter editor, visa clerk, fingerprint clerk, etc. etc. - all the fun jobs at the embassy.<br /><br />The Functional Fellowships would allow spouses/partners who have the educational background but lacking specific work experience, to work at our US Missions in order to gain specialized experience in a progressive manner. At the conclusion of the fellowship, he/she should have the option of applying for the specialist vacancy relevant to his/her experience. For this to work, the fellowships must be based on educational qualifications, past performance, and potential and must be centrally funded.

3827-4049	Chain Saws and Scalpels	2009-05-28 00:00:00	An all too common practice both in the Federal government and the commercial sector when faced with shrinking budgets is to simply make across the board cuts. In other words, we take out our chain saw and just reduce funding for all programs by the same percent. If we were to ask ourselves if all programs as equally important to the organization, I propose that 9 out of 10 of us would answer "No". So why do we continue to use our chain saws? The answer is that it's easier and avoids political battles.<br /><br />While certainly easier, the chain saw method is likely to produce inferior results to the scalpel method. With the scalpel method we consider the benefit of a given program relative to other programs along with the funds required to achieve the benefit. In doing so we will likely find that some programs should be cut even more significantly, others not cut at all and even some should receive increased funding. <br /><br />So this all sounds good, but how do we handle the associated politics and use our scalpels efficiently? There are approaches that enable organizations to efficiently reach their priorities, gain buy-in among stakeholders and selectively allocate their funds. Organizations such as NASA and the Bureau of Land Management are such organizations and they are beginning to reap the rewards. <br /><br />I'd imagine that any of us who plan to have surgery would much rather see our surgeon pull out a scalpel than a chainsaw. Let's give our budgeting the same care.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>As Federal organizations face increasing requirements for accountability around how they allocate their funds, using more effective budgeting approaches will make it much easier to justify their funding decisions.</div><br />	rdougherty	10	12	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3827-4049

3832-4049	A different way of looking at Afghanistan, that does not demonize the Taliban	2009-05-28 00:00:00	The June, 2002, National Assembly (Loya Jirga) held in Afghanistan to select the head of state was rigged by the Bush administration, forcing the former king, who had majority support among the delegates, to withdraw from consideration*. This shows that the "Bush freedom agenda" was basically a sham--a political gimmick, a phony; and that Karzai is a U.S. puppet. Once he was installed, the subsequent elections, held without established political parties, were little more than a rubber stamp. <br /> <br />However, many Americans think that the U.S. brought freedom to Afghanistan, and cling to the notion of Afghanistan as "the good war." The original U.S. sin behind the lack of legitimacy of the Karzai regime, although factually incontrovertible, has remained almost unnoticed. <br /> <br />The result is that blame for the situation tends to be placed on other factors, such as corruption and poor governance. Both are essentially a function of government weakness. But a puppet regime is weak virtually by definition. <br /> <br />The decision to sideline the king aggravated the disenfranchisement and oppression of the Pashtun tribes (the majority political element in Afghanistan) occasioned by U.S. support for the Northern Alliance and other warlords. Northern Afghanistan, for example, has been brutally ethnic-cleansed of Pashtuns since 2001--another fact that has remained almost completely unreported.<br /> <br />But as Vartan Gregorian, the great historian of modern Afghanistan, warned in 2001, "Pashtuns won't easily relinquish two centuries of memory and power. Without a major Pashtun role in the future of Afghanistan, there will be no viable peace." Gregorian also noted that the king was welcome, but not as a U.S. puppet. <br /> <br />It is sufficient to take a look at a map of the insurgency to see that it is practically the same as an ethnic map of Pashtun areas (including the Pashtun areas of Pakistan). <br /> <br />This is why throwing more military forces into the cauldron, and killing more Pashtuns, is not the best solution--and it is hardly a freedom and self-determination solution. It will perpetuate and, indeed, exacerbate a disastrous internal contradiction in U.S. policy. <br /> <br />As for tribal militias, so-called "Arbakai"--villagers armed with rifles--are not much to keep the Taliban at bay. Large scale, heavily armed and lavishly financed militias, like the Uzbeg militia led by the infamous General Dostam, were organized by the Soviets before their pullout in 1989, and proved effective in staving off the collapse of the Soviet-supported regime--until they turned against it. <br /> <br />What is needed is not handing out wads of cash, but a political solution based on reconciliation with the Pashtun tribes. In the words of a British colonial statesman, "An Afghan ruler rules only by the goodwill of the most powerful Afghan tribes" (Sir Olaf Caroe). <br /> <br />It is the fundamental compact of allegiance between the tribes and the central government that needs to be reestablished. Such a compact is not a pipe dream, but something that actually existed as the historical basis of the Afghan state, and which, under the monarchy, afforded Afghanistan generations of progress and peace. <br /> <br />In fact, bribing tribal leaders is utterly incompatible with a genuine political process, just as bribing voters is incompatible with a democratic election. And if the bribing is done by foreigners, the affront is even worse, and the bribes are not likely to work, except on a very short-term basis.<br /> <br />Strange and anachronistic as it may seem, even at this late date the royal family are probably the only ones who can hope to do it--although not necessarily any of the king's sons, and within a republican, not a monarchical framework. The political capital accumulated by the Musahiban in the last century still hasn't dissipated, nor been appropriated by anyone else, least of all poor Hamid Karzai. <br /> <br />The most suitable forum is likely to be a new Loya Jirga, hopefully to be convened by the end of the current presidential term. To have a chance of success, any arrangement will require a fundamental rebalancing of power away from the non-Pashtun actors who have dominated the scene since 2001. <br /> <br />Those actors will resist, if given a chance: and it is precisely by deterring and preventing such resistances that the American military will find more fruitful employment than in savaging the tribes. <br /> <br />However, now that both the old king and his senior cousin, General Abdul Wali, are no longer around, everything will be harder, and the prospects more uncertain.<br /> <br />___________________________________________________<br /> <br />* http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E1DF123CF937A25755C0A9649C8B63&sec;=&spon;=&pagewanted;=all , retrieved on Feb. 9, 2009.

In that capacity, he worked closely with a number of Afghan resistance organizations, becoming personally familiar with many Afghan political figures. He has analyzed Afghan politics for thirty years. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The Taliban started as a geuine popular movement to clean up the mess caused in Afghanistan by Pakistan's meddling. The latter country then succeeded in forming an alliance with the Taliban movement, supporting them and using them for its own purposes, ultimately resulting in the Al Qaeda attacks (not that Pakistan planned them; their Arab fundamentalist allies stole a march on them). It is the fanatical Islamist elements (like Hekmatyar, rumored to be in talks with Holbrooke) that must be ruthlessly opposed; and it is the TRIBAL component of the Taliban movement that instead must be engaged politically, and met more than half way. In other words, the present policy is a recipe for unmitigated confrontation with the Pashtun tribes, which will have to be abandoned to arrive at a political reconciliation with them--or else, either the Afghan tribes will have to be brutally broken (which may well prove beyond the degree of cruelty and savagery that the US government will be politically able to exercise, hopefully) or the present Obama policy will fail, probably breaking his presidency and leaving the region an even worse mess.</div><br />	cristcaster	-5	8	13	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3832-4049

We need to get rid of direct hire practices or make them open for all to see. Everyone should be able to see who applicants are/were and how they compared to one another. Individuals should not be hired on the basis of degree alone; several years of experience should carry the same weight as an advanced degree. The government should also not be hiring individuals with little or no experience at close to and including six figure salaries. Especially when there are other qualified applicants that are capable and willing to do the same job starting at lower salaries.

In their current structure they do not ensure that ratings are in line with actual performance and they are highly subjective rather then objective allowing for varied interpretations and abuse by managers who want to play favorites and not look at the work that has actually been achieved. Written performance measures should be established at all levels for all elements and at one level above and one level below the fully successful level. If this is done managers and employees will all know what is expected of them and how to achieve the desired rating.

I loved my job during active duty for over the eight years I served in the Army. I scoffed at the idea during my initial training in Fort Lee, VA., when told by a female cadre, that if I wanted to make the military a career -- never have children. I was married and we did not have children until 8 years into my supply logistics career. I reluctantly left the service when little support was available for adequate childcare in my overseas assignment. I was stationed in Weisbaden, Germany at the time. My command did their best to ease the adjustment of motherhood and soldiering. I was an E-5(P) supply sergeant for 142d S&S; Bn, 29th S&S; Co. However, the undercurrent and common attitude held at that time was that if "Uncle Sam" wanted a soldier to have a family, it would have been issued to you.<br /><br />I could not put the quality of life of my daughter above my choice to be a soldier. However, it was a difficult choice and one I struggled with. There has to be better system in place. I was on track for BNOC and then to be assigned as a Drill Sergeant, when I became pregnant and that had to be cancelled. <br /><br />Why accept females in the military if not all aspects of their needs can be met? I understand that defending our country is paramount and being ready at a momentâ&euro;&trade;s notice to move-out is necessary. I had no problems with that. I have a problem with non-existent childcare providers, especially if both parents work or are on active duty. <br /><br />My spouse had power of attorney if I had been sent into a combat theater. That was not the problem. The problem I discovered is performing the day-to-day operations in garrison while training for upcoming missions. There has to be a better way to evaluate how to support military families if those families are to accompany active duty military members on assignments not in a combat arena.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Women need more choices and a better system to meet the needs of all dependent family members.

3846-4049	Post Voting System Electronic Audit Logs online in every jurisdiction	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Electronic voting systems--both the optical scan systems that count paper ballots and the direct recording electronic (DRE) "touchscreen" voting systems--produce about a dozen different "audit logs" after each election. It is difficult (sometimes impossible) and expensive for citizens to try to obtain these logs, even though they are public records. The logs can reveal procedural problems, problems with the machines themselves, and fraud. Currently, the more an elections administrator has to hide, the harder it is to obtain these records. Our non-profit, nonpartisan, election watchdog organization has spent thousands of dollars trying to obtain these audit logs from Florida counties. Some counties are cooperative, but in some cases we are still waiting for records as far back as the 2004 election, or have been told they are "lost," "the hard drive failed," "the logs are not in human readable form," and other suspect reasons for not producing the most basic information about the conduct of an election. It would be very simple for elections offices to post these logs on the website of each county's election department immediately following every election -- it is simply an electronic transfer of these records. In fact, there is no good reason NOT to post these logs except to cover up machine malfunctions, incompetence, malfeasance, or some other problem. The "poll tapes" (results tapes) from each machine should also be posted. These tapes are supposed to be public information, but in some places such as Pima County, Arizona, citizens have been told that these results tapes are "secret." The poll tapes can be a vital check on election results and should never be secret. Requiring them to be posted online would allow every citizen to look at his/her own precinct and would help to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the election.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The immediate posting of all electronic audit logs from an election would go a long way towards cutting down on election violations by election "insiders" (i.e. election administrators). As things stand now, our elections are an "inside job" from the certification of the voting machines through the certification of the election, with little or no oversight and no system of checks and balances in place. The public posting of election audit logs and poll tapes IMMEDIATELY AFTER EVERY ELECTION is an important step in providing checks and balances in the administration of elections. Citizens should not have to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to obtain the very records that are a vital component in ensuring whether an election was accurate and properly administered.</div><br />	susanpynchon	32	32	0	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3846-4049

3851-4049	Health Care ReInsurance	2009-05-28 00:00:00	This might not be the forum, but I think this is an interesting idea that has not received any discussion.<br /><br />I know a lot of people want single payer health care. This idea is not intended to demote that idea. However, if our government decides that single payer is not the way to go, we somehow have to make the insurance system work. This idea addresses that. Please don't vote against it just because you'd prefer to see single payer!<br /><br />We are all concerned about the cost of health care. To insure a family can easily cost upwards of $10,000-20,000 per year.<br /><br />I believe that one of the reasons health insurance is so expensive is because some people cost the system a whole lot of money. Cancer, heart transplant, HIV, etc. So the cost of those really expensive cases has to be built into everyone's insurance.<br /><br />After 9/11 the government introduced terrorism insurance. The idea with this insurance was that after a certain cost threshold and for particular events, the government would cover a big % of the insurance claims, and the insurer would cover just a portion (90%/10%, I believe).<br /><br />Why not do the same for health insurance. Have a program where, if a single individual costs more than $X in a single year, the insurance company can get the government involved and ultimately the government would cover a big part of the cost.<br /><br />Many big news reports (and movies) are about insurance companies refusing expensive treatments to really sick people. For the insurance company that is a huge amount of money that can be saved with a single "No." If only a part of that were their money, they could pay more attention to the benefit and less to the cost.<br /><br />Example: once an individual costs $100k over any 12mo period, the government could be on the hook for 80% of the additional cost. Of couse there would probably be case managers, etc, but those controls would be a separate detail.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Part of the cost of health insurance is to cover catastrophic health events. Insurance companies are incentivised to deny really expensive procedures. By providing insurance companies with backup insurance for really expensive cases, the cost of health insurance for everyone can more closely resemble the cost to cover the average person.</div><br />	Peter Jackson	-5	8	13	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3851-4049

3859-4049	Create a Consilidated System for Tax Calculation, Payment & Compliance	2009-05-28 00:00:00	This country probably has 1000 different taxes. These are imposed on many different levels: federal, state, county, city, etc.<br /><br />To comply with all these taxes, an individual or a business must know about them and know who, what, and how to report and remit.<br /><br />A new small business is possibly faced with many rules and taxes they have never heard of! Ultimately, they have to hire an attorney to figure it out. Even then they are likely to miss something and have to pay interest and penalties. If they expand to another jurisdiction (or even ship to another jurisdiction) they are face with learning that jurisdiction's laws too.<br /><br />I realize that our Federal system (decentralized government) makes this hard, but what if there were one go-to agency (with a website) where you could enter your zip code and type of business and be presented all of the different requirements on you.<br /><br />Ideally this agency would also provide the mechanism to calculate and remit the amounts owed.<br /><br />How much simpler would a small employer's life be if they could go to one website, enter their payroll data, and have all the taxes and withholdings calculated and remitted? Then one agency that would come to them to audit and assure compliance.<br /><br />I am hesitant to suggest that the IRS be that agency, because it is so ponderous and feared, but some central agency who's central mission is to make compliance easy would make so many employers, small businesses, & individuals lives so much easier. Perhaps the agency could be managed by a board with members representing affected jurisdictions (and, hopefully, taxpayers). They agency might be funded by taking a (very small) cut on the taxes it collects.<br /><br />This does not mean that the taxes should all be set by the federal government. Our system of innovation at the local level is important. Instead it could work something like this:<br /><br />The agency would develop an extensible structure (rules based system) by which local jurisdictions could define their tax system in a standardized manner (who does it apply to, what is the basis, what deductions are possible, what are the rates, etc.). The agency's computers would then apply those rules. <br /><br />Jurisdictions would be incentivized to create tax rules that were implementable with the agency's system. But they would not have to. There would also be an exception system where instead the jurisdiction could just use the agency's system to inform the taxpayer that there is a tax and how to go about calculating and remitting it (i.e., "if you do X in location Y, see this website"). The agency, however, would have as a goal (a metric of success) the minimization of these exceptions. They would do that by (a)convincing the jurisdiction of the value of using the agency's calculation methods, (b)expanding the calculation system to include the rules the jurisdiction needs, or (c)some compromise between the two.<br /><br />Finally, jurisdictions would not have to participate at all. They would be welcome to do it the old fashioned way. But I imagine, if the agency does a good job, no jurisdiction would want to ignore the agency completely. If nothing else, the agency would provide the jurisdiction another way to inform its taxpayers of their obligations.<br /><br />A system like this could be invaluable for businesses doing multi-state transactions. The turf wars over sales taxes are heating up. Eventually the smallest internet seller is going to have an impossible time properly complying with all the tax laws. What if the seller could just enter in the zip code of the seller and the zip code of the buyer, the transaction amount, and the type of transaction and the system would calculate tax and ultimately remit the tax to the appropriate local jurisdictions?<br /><br />With the advent of the computer, the internet, on-line banking, etc., the system we have now of forms and agencies is antiquated! Everyone (the IRS, local jurisdictions, taxpayers) would save money by having a centralized system like I've described. Compliance would go up, cost to comply would go down, cost to collect would go down. Everyone would be much happier.<br /><br />As for auditing, local jurisdictions would retain the right to audit their taxpayers. But the central agency could also provide that service...they would audit automatically as part of their compliance enforcement, but they might also respond to audit requests from jurisdictions (either general requests or requests to audit particular aspects of a particular taxpayer), perhaps at the jurisdiction's expense.<br /><br />Centralized reporting means that all agencies that a taxpayer pays tax to would be privy to all the same information automatically. The whole system of W-2s and 1099s would be built in. One audit would assure compliance with all affected taxes.<br /><br />One implementation of this idea would be a centralized system of servers that apply rules based calculation methods and store historical transaction data which would then communicate with front-end systems via XML and related technologies. The agency would provide a front end, but it would also be open so that third parties could also write front ends.<br /><br />QuickBooks, for example, could be a front end, automatically sending XML information to the central system which would respond with how much tax is owed for any particular transaction. This could be virtually real time, allowing taxpayers to fulfill their obligations and jurisdictions to receive their revenue much faster. This would create a competitive marketplace to be each person or businessâ&euro;&trade;s calculation and remittance provider.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Compliance is dizzyingly difficult when there are so many jurisdictions, so many different kinds of taxes, and so many different ways to calculate them. Standardizing and centralizing the reporting, calculation and collection would lessen costs for the tax payer and the jurisdictions.</div><br />	Peter Jackson	4	5	1	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3859-4049

Then switch the welfare budget priorities to reflect the reality of what it costs to live in America.<br />3. $200.00 per month is too little if you are disabled and can't cook; therefore having to eat out 3 meals a day.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Because the current arrangement is not working. If the caseworker individually asses the abilities of the client, people like me can easily get by on less foodstamps. Clearly the cash to keep a house and utilities is completly inadeqquate.

3862-4049	BANK REFORM - Un-Privatize banking - ban gov't borrowing and deficit spending.	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Our banking system is a privately-owned, for-profit enterprise based on fraud. It is owned and run by the international banking cartel because congress passed a law in 1913 (the Federal Reserve Act) creating the FED (a privately owned bank) and legalizing/granting a monopoly on the creation of money to the private banker owners via the FED.<br /><br />Uh-oh. That's bad because it requires the US gov't to BORROW money AT INTEREST for government projects and operations from the FED and incurs an ever-increasing federal debt. Simply put, this is an economically and ecologically unsustainable system. It is an enormous monopoly game whose endgame, where the bankers have all the money, property and control and everyone else is broke, is what we are experiencing now. Our fraudulent banking system is at the root of our current economic meltdown. The interest on the debts has grown so large that the citizens and the country simply cannot pay anymore. Current government actions, the bailout and other schemes put forth by (guess who) bankers are aimed at propping up the current system as long as possible, instead of actually reforming banking so that it works for everyone.<br /><br />WHAT WE SHOULD DO:<br /><br /> • Repeal the Federal Reserve Act and make debt-free treasury money the legal tender of the realm.<br /> If the government can write a check, they can issue money--it's all done with the stroke of a key these days...<br /> This would break the bankers' monopoly and the stranglehold they have on the US economy.<br /><br /> • Pay off the federal debt to the FED with all the worthless Federal reserve notes traded in for US Treasury Notes.<br /> This would retire the debt and we would no longer need to spend our tax money paying interest on it.<br /><br /> • Create Treasury banks to lend to businesses and individuals, using the interest on those loans to fund gov't <br /> operations and projects that enhance the well-being of the nation, -- education, research, infrastructure, etc.<br /><br /> • Form an Monetary Committee to oversee all banking activites including sales of deriviatives and draft <br /> Ellen Brown, J.D., author of "The Web Of Debt and What We Can Do To Break Free" to oversee the <br /> implementation of the 3 suggestions above.<br /><br />I admit, I have only scratched the surface of these issues. These suggestions may not be the full answer to our woes but taking these steps would go along way toward straightening out our banking system and building a healthy and sustainable economy. An excellent analysis of how banking really works and affects all of us can be found at www.webofdebt.com, Other resources include the videos/films "From Freedom to Facism", "Money As Debt" --if you can still find it on the internet. It has been banned from google video and is expected to be removed from YouTube soon. And the video/film "The Money Masters".<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This is important because in our current banking system a) the interest paid to private bankers constitutes a huge and permanent drain on our economy, b) allowing private banks to create money out of thin air from nothing whenever a loan is issued is highly inflationary and transfers wealth from those who work for it to the banking cartel (who just issue/loan out some more and collect interest) via shrinking the dollar, c) prevents the interest on loans of (debt-free treasury money) from being recycled into the US economy, funding projects for the common good such as health care, education, infrastructure, etc. and d) robs the Government (and by extension the citizens) of oversight of the banks' activities.<br /><br />Making the suggested changes would free up money currently spent on servicing the federal debt and recycle it into the economy via government spending, return oversight of banking to the government --no more giving banks bailouts and having them refuse to resume lending-- and it would limit the ability of private bankers to hold the government hostage by tightening credit and creating recessions/depressions.<br /><br />All remedies for this current depression require funding and I'm all for the stimulus, but if the stimulus money is borrowed money, it may help temporarily but it will contribute to the federal debt and thus increase the flow of cash to private bankers, exacerbating the financial mess we are in. When borrowed stimulus money runs out, then what? Borrow more?</div><br />	lihu	10	15	5	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3862-4049

That way there would be a continuing conversation.<br /><br />2) That the procedures for finding ideas be improved, perhaps by open sourcing it, so that a user could show the Idea titles ordered by say: Recent, Top, Controversial, Tag, Title-Contents, Tag, and others that I don't think about.<br /><br />3) Start moving toward threaded, rated... comments so that it might be easer to benefit form the comment stream.<br /><br />4) Attach a Pro and a Con WIKI to each idea to see if the people who voted Pro, and Con could develop detailed proposals for their ideas. (Note: this might not work, but I'd like to see if it did)<br /><br />5) Try to involve our representatives and allow them to comment on the ideas and identify their comment<br /><br />6) Add a "Preview" (I forget if this is implemented, though I'd replace "Post" by "Preview and then Post") and "Speller" so that the submitter could see who the posting and comment looks before it is submitted. <br /><br />Others... I'd be interested to read other suggestions and cements on the specifics by people who, hopefully, could make constructive additions and modifications to this idea<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This would be the continuation of a three way discussion between our representatives and us and between each other. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div><br />	Mike Liveright	18	19	1	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3863-4049	
3864-4049	Save $ & Reduce Pet Overpopulation	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Each year, millions of dogs and cats are euthanized in shelters. Besides the morality issue with these killings, there is also the financial issue. It costs localities and states a lot of money to shelter these animals and then kill them. It also costs a lot of money to round up strays, and there are public health issues associated with strays too.<br /><br />The underlying cause of these costs and miseries is pet overpopulation. Why not have the federal government offer grant programs to the states/localities if they can develop a plan to reduce pet overpopulation within their jurisdiction over a set period of time, let's say five years. By creating federal incentives, the state/local governments will have more motivation to take action on this serious problem.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It will ultimately save tax dollars and contribute to public health while reducing cruelty to animals. </div><br />	ksherbin	4	11	7	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3864-4049	
3865-4049	Use XML for easy retrieval of messages	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Currently the government uses standardized messages to communicate between agencies. There is some parsing that happens with standard messages but it mostly has to be viewed in an email inbox which is tedious and time consuming. A lot of vital information is missed due to the fact that everyone needs to go thru all messages to see what pertains to them. This wastes bandwidth and time. Additionally it is combersom to ensure the message is appropriately addressed to get to the commands and agencies that need it.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>A lot of time and money is spent in getting new directives and notifications out to all of the agencies and commands. Messages should be on a "pull" basis rather than a "push" (like the email model). Using XML to tag messages that pertain to a subject would enable an easy and intuitive way in posting the data and the commands/agencies that need these types of inforation can easily turn off and on the types of messages they want to see. Bandwidth will be reduced and time will be saved in easily sorting thru all of the pertanant messages that pertain to their mission. All agencies should be given a standardized message generation software tool to easily tag and transmit messages.</div><br />	mrkelley	4	7	3	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3865-4049	
3866-4049	Design Training and Education to be interactive, participant-centered and experiential	2009-05-28 00:00:00	(for those of you unfamiliar with these terms, see this description of interactive learning: http://www.openingspace.net/interactiveLearning_whatIsIt.shtml - in this case, I am talking about face-to-face learning - but technology for learning can and is also being used to engage more than text on a screen or audio in a podcast)<br /><br />We have learned much about learning. We have learned that designing training and education in more interactive ways increases learners' ability to integrate and retain learning and also learn concepts, not just facts.<br /><br />Interactive learning design includes not just a design of the facts to teach, but the whole 'ecology of learning', if you will. Placement around / use of / movement in the room, group dynamics and dialogue, using more than text or oral receipt of information. People absorb and exchange information / data differently, so to reach all forms of learners, a good interactive learning facilitator designs her/his workshops or presentations engaging more of the different modalities of learning. Instead of lecture or PowerPoint, more hands-on or teach-each other forms of learning. Instead of just delivering information through text or audio (lecture or reading), us of multiple modalities such as graphic, kinesthetic and/or relational learning. Instead of the same dynamic throughout the lesson, mixing in small group or duo discussion and discovery, silent reflective work, use of materials, and other approaches such as role play or scenario work, use of graphic templates or tools for participants, and moving to indicate such things as different places on a continuum or different points of view. Instead of question-and-answer, interactive dialogue and inquiry. Instead of the teacher 'owning' the information, designing learning so information is put into the hands of the learners and part of their learning is figuring out how to teach their peers.<br /><br />My recommendation is to raise the capacity of those who present, teach and invite learning in government, business, educational institutions, non-profits and community. To teach interactive learning methodology; to shift folks 'at the front of the room' from 'expert' or 'knowledge holders' to learning facilitators. <br /><br />With all of these recommendations about the use of facilitation or interactive learning, there are many of us who do this as a profession and several ways to locate and invite us into re-designing learning and training trainers and presenters nation-wide and internationally (the US government and US organizations do so much in so many locations around the world) <br /><br />Organizations such as International Association of Facilitators, National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation, American Society for Training and Development, many other organizations, associations, educational programs and regional networks of facilitators and trainers have within them people who specialize in designing and teaching how to teach and present using interactive methodology. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>To be engaged citizens and collaborative neighbors in the world community; to be at the top of our game; to be innovative and creative in our thinking; to learn not just facts but concepts; to engage with others in our learning; to understand relationship and value; to strengthen our ability to draw inferences and think critically; to share knowledge; to increase capacity...<br /><br />Please feel free, readers, to add other organizations, networks and institutions where professionals skilled at teaching interactive learning methodology can be drawn from.</div><br />	lisaheft	17	18	1	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3866-4049

All government employee data that is common between all of the military and government agencies should be standardized to ease in tracking and manegment.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Currently to get a record updated a government employee has to check sometimes up to three different sources to ensure they all match. Additionally, one military branch has a certain form for requesting xyz, while another branch has a different form for requesting the same thing. All forms and documentation should be the same to enable inter-service requests to save in development costs.</div><br />	mrkelley	4	9	5	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3868-4049

3872-4049	Increase the use of dialogic methods in business, government, non-profit and community	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Dialogue is not just for groups to come to an agreement, engage citizens or make a decision. <br /><br />Dialogic methods are also used to help groups think faster, more creatively, and more productively while engaging all the knowledge, wisdom, experience and diversity in the room in an interdisciplinary, intercultural, dynamic manner.<br /><br />Note here that I am including in the term dialogue both methods / tools / processes that invite speaking as those which invite listening and reflection. In true dialogue, there are both the speaker(s) and those who are truly listening. And dialogue also includes both outer (such as talking or inquiring) and inner dialogue (such as thinking while drawing, journaling, reflecting in silence before speaking)<br /><br />My recommendation is to design more dialogic tools into business, government, non-profits and communities, both in the U.S. and in any project, program, activity or office the U.S. has in other parts of the world.<br /><br />Facilitators such as myself have seen the use of dialogue in such examples as:<br />- dialogue before budgeting, to figure out new ways to spend over a billion dollars worth of international aid money<br />- dialogue before strategic planning to help a global organization's information technology department be more innovative and more service-oriented in a changing business climate<br />- program and product design that has broken through to new geographic regions or new marketplaces because dialogue helped people think in full-systems, interdisciplinary ways<br />- meetings where organizations or businesses invite not just the 'experts' but also consumers, partners, peers and even competitors for needs assessment, response to urgent issues, or knowledge exchange<br />- dialogue in governmental agencies working in other countries to foster collaboration, examine issues of sensitivity and engages all members of international staff in a way that invites all voices in spite of different cultural dynamics<br />- meetings, conferences, forums or planning sessions that include people of different levels of power, or minority voices and create an environment of inclusion and invitation to speak and share knowledge across culture and across differences<br />... and I could go on.<br /><br />If I may speak for us - those of us in the profession of facilitation have seen groups accomplish amazing things when dialogic and interactive processes have been used.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Think how amazing we could be in business, government and community if we could tap into the wisdom and experience in diverse groups in a better way than linear, presentation-based meetings. It is already happening - my recommendation is to teach these tools and to work with facilitators to raise our capacity to engage each other in discussion, dialogue, interchange and innovation.</div><br />	lisaheft	18	19	1	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3872-4049

The Web-based tools that were used as part of the Obama campaign allowed people to easily sign up for shifts doing phone banking, canvassing, bringing food, etc. This capability could easily be extended to non-profits across the country, most of whom don't have the funds or technological expertise to stand up such a site. <br /><br />My employer (IBM) and no doubt other organizations would be interested in supporting this idea, and with a public/private partnership, it could be a very modest government investment with a very visible and important return.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>We could dramatically increase the amount of volunteering done in the U.S. by making it easier for people to do so. </div><br />	brendagdixon	15	17	2	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3873-4049

Then some companies got in the middle between the patients and the providers and "handled the money". I don't call this a healthcare system.<br /><br />I see no reason for there to be any middlemen (or middle companies) involved in healthcare. This is not like auto or home insurance where some people will never use it. Health care is something that every person will use sooner or later (although some use it more).<br /><br />What we need is negotiated fair prices for all health-related services. There would be no "health insurance companies" making profits off of sick people. The government already provides health care "insurance" to its workers (elected officials) and to the poor and retired (MediCal or MedicAid), it should really provide services to all who desire them. Certainly, wealthy people may still obtain services however they desire.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This is one of the biggest issues we have in the USA. Health care costs continue to rise largely because of the 'cut' that the health 'insurance' companies take out of the middle.

3876-4049	Make elections friendlier to third parties	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Reform elections so that, if no one gets 50% of the vote, the third party candidate can throw their support (votes) behind his or her choice. This way people would actually feel more free to vote for the candidate they really want, knowing that even if the candidate has virtually no chance of winning, the vote will ultimately be passed along to the most compatible of the front-runners, and it will not be a wasted vote, or create a spoiler situation where the less popular major candidate can win because the more popular perspective's supporters are split between more candidates. Ultimately, this may break the stranglehold the two parties have on our current system... which is why it will be nearly impossible to get any Democrats or Republicans to support this kind of idea... but it would be a big move toward a more open and democratic government.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The effective restriction of winners to only two parties ultimately limits ideas, forces positions toward the status quo, and even seems to result in increasing similarity between the two parties in many areas.

3887-4049	Global Architecture Integration Network Initiaive	2009-05-28 00:00:00	There is a key enabler for collaboration, transparency, and more effective and efficient government. That key enabler is to be able to share, understand and federate our enterprise-business and I.T. architectures at all levels. Architecture, in this sense, is inclusive: embracing everything from a multi-national plan to the structure of a database. Architectures describe organizations, systems of systems, individual systems, information, services, resources and processes.<br /><br />To be able to collaborate, understand, share or reuse requires that the information about organizations, systems or data be easily shared, found, understood and federated. When we create a multi-organizational initiative, that initiative has to federate architectures from its components parts and needs to federate with the architectures of organizations it collaborates with. When we want to utilize data, we must understand the architecture and vocabulary of that data. By improving our ability to share and federate our architectures we improve our ability to collaborate, share and reuse. We can't use what we don't understand.<br /><br />Federation is key - none of these organizations, systems or resources stands alone and none can control the other. By federating our architectures we create something larger than the sum of its parts and a critical resource for government and industry. We enable our national priorities.<br /><br />The problem we face is that this pivotal information is not readily accessible, it is in a variety of standard and proprietary formats and is not able to be published and linked in a way that is easily consumable. To be useful this information must be web-accessible, linked and standards based. We have existing standards and technologies that can help, but they have not been put together for this purpose. We have also not put together the governance framework for managing such a federated environment.<br /><br />Our proposal is an initiative for a "Global Architecture Integration Network" (GAIN) based on our existing internet capabilities enhanced with open standards and open technologies. GAIN could help with some of our hardest problems: Healthcare, Financial Recovery, Joint Forces, and Terrorism.

3889-4049	One Bill = One Idea	2009-05-28 00:00:00	One thing I find frustrating is that congress can pass a bill with "hidden" mini laws. <br /><br />For example, congress recently passed a bill to reform credit card companies and it also included a provision allowing people to carry handguns into national parks. What? How do those two ideas relate?<br /><br />Those items should have been two separate bills. I know politics is about compromise; but, I want congress debating the details of credit card reform and not slipping in a gun law so that they can get a few extra votes. This seems disingenuous. <br /><br />Each bill should focus on one idea/concept/law. This only seems fair.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Makes the passage of bills straightforward.

3893-4049	Progressive tax on companies approaching 	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Progressive tax on companies approaching "too big to fail" sizes. (Taxpayer protection)<br /><br />Future bailouts of wall street, big manufacturing and other important companies should be EXPECTED and prepared for.<br /><br />Taxpayers should not be ultimately driven to bail out companies that are deemed too big to fail. And, ideally successful companies should be allowed to legally grow without a hard upper limit.<br /><br />To satisfy both needs, significant graduating taxes as companies get very large will create a size-driven negative feedback loop that gives companies an incentive to stay in the "not too huge to fail" band. Simultaneously, the risk pool capital raised by these taxes will serve to offset losses to the taxpayers for those rare catastrophic failures.<br /><br />This is essentially bail-out insurance for the taxpayer (as ultimate insurer) with a risk-adjusted premium, combined with a self-limiting incentive to corporate size. (Note: Bailout cannot be guaranteed, as this would generate an unacceptable moral hazard, leading to imprudent risk taking.)<br /><br />A side benefit of this idea is that it will promote a healthier non-monopolistic marketplace because dis-economies of scale will kick in on the huge dominant players.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This idea is important because it protects the taxpayer *WHEN* companies fail. It privatizes some of the risk, and socializes some of the benefit, quite the opposite of what we see today.</div><br />	bobhilt1	3	9	6	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3893-4049

3897-4049	Training For Sustainable Green Businesses	2009-05-28 00:00:00	To create sustainable green jobs, you must have both technical training, and green business training. You need real, down to earth training that is focused on the unique nature of running a successful green business. To be effective you also need to use the power of the Internet to take this training to communities both big and small.<br /><br />You may say, there are thousands of business classes offered by universities and private companies. That is true, but starting and sustaining a successful green business requires a whole different set of skills. Some are standard that transcend any business, accounting, business formation, legal structure and so on. But others are unique to this market:<br /><br />How do you tell people about your product or service? <br />Why do they need it? <br />How do you measure success, both for your client and your business? <br />You need unique product training for your employees. <br />You need to be ready and able to support your installation. <br />You need performance standards. <br />You need to explain to people what is a carbon footprint, how to measure theirs, what they can do to reduce it and why. <br />And even something as seemingly simple as what is "green".<br /><br />And you don't have time for a theoretical or academic discussion. Contractors and trades people are not inclined to set still for months and years. They want the facts, they want them now and they want to get on with the business.<br /><br />It also seems absurd to drag people for miles, wasting gas, housing them, taking valuable time just to send them home to be "environmentally conscious". Saving energy and reducing our carbon footprint must start from day one! There are very powerful and interactive tools that can bring high quality training to their home, wherever they live. Its time to bring these skills to everyone. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Without real and focused green business training, all the money dumped into this field will be short lived and wasted. </div><br />	dan	9	11	2	3	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3897-4049

Some have raised concerns about the trustworthiness of the information, the sifting and editing of scenarios and background information used to inform and prompt public engagement. Might a wiki-public issues site be worth exploring here, where the conventions of non-partisan, self-correcting information generation would co-produce a trusted, balanced overview of issues of concern and proposed policies in plain language. Public and private sector experts, citizens, and consumers/producers could contribute to shaping the issue descriptions providing a full 360 perspectives on how all stakeholders are being affected. <br /><br />This wiki system could be developed at multiple scales so the issues would be generated and translatable at the appropriate local, state, regional and national perspectives.

The old way of trying to protect the government by restricting the capacity of government employees should give way to a new, more agile and effective approach. <br /><br />The government needs to retain, in the civil service, qualified and innovative minds. Proactive and positive change should be rewarded while protecting the "way we have always done it" should be discouraged when that way isn't working.<br /><br />This would then involve trusting these qualified and motivated individuals to perform and rewarding them when they do. Regulations will never stop corruption or inefficiency. What will stop these is visibility. <br /><br />So a formula for more effective government is to get the right people in the right positions, give them the authority and flexibility to act. Reward effective risk taking and make everything they do open and visible. When they are not effective, get rid of them!<br /><br />Visibility can replace many of the polices and culture that are not working, for example the entire process for government acquisition.

It has its critics, but most would agree it's potential has not been realized. I recommend a review of the implementation of "reg negs" and update of the law to incorporate the tenets of open government and the use of new communication and engagement technologies. <br /><br />"Negotiated rulemaking is a process in American administrative law in which an advisory committee made up of disparate interest groups negotiates the terms of an administrative rule and proposes it to an agency. The agency publishes the rule in the Federal Register as a proposed rule and uses the normal rulemaking procedure of soliciting and evaluating public comments in order to decide whether to modify or adopt it." (Wikipedia)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The use of "Reg-neg" can be greatly improved if modernized to take advantage of new technologies to engage more people at the real and virtual tables.

There has been no stop in people losing their jobs or homes, but by golly that new nature park in Iowa or Idaho is being tended to and that airport of John Murtha's who has more employees than passengers is getting billions, too bad about the poor.

3908-4049	The Cyber Czar idea 	2009-05-28 00:00:00	The very idea of a cyber Czar as A figure head for the cyber problem is great! <br /> <br />However, this person must have real power, he or she also needs to be a person who understands the problem with experience. <br /> <br />Example #1 Who better to handle cyber crime then A Ex-Hacker? <br />If the czar is just some college grad know it all with a degree in some soft technology, all hackers will just take it as A challenge. <br /> <br />When our parents told us not to do something, without backing it up with facts and real understanding.<br /> It only made us want to try it that much more. <br /> <br /> <br />#2 If the czar understands softcode/hardcode language and math re-direction aka hacking/code breaking. That would be a big plus. <br />With that education on the matter he would be better suited for helping government agencies & private sector coprs protect them selves. <br /> <br />Protection does not stop with a firewall. Many 14 year old kids with a small platform reformat hack can bypass a firewall. <br /> <br />You need A czar who has A clear record of botching hacks for some company in the private sector. <br /> <br />#3 You need a czar with A staff of hundreds of Ex-hackers at his call 24/7. <br />The only true way to combat cyber offenders is with ex-cyber offenders. <br /> <br />I've met MIT grads who are less skilled then some of these 20 year old kids working on A basement direct-net network. <br /> <br />In terms of protecting government networks from cyber abuse. <br />I suggest creating false directives. <br /> <br />#3 The False directive. <br />When A hacker of any kind enters A protected matrix realm of be it software/network/program. They have already spent hours if not days understanding the basic ins and outs of whatever it was they planned on attacking. <br />The more obvious direct route out is usually taken. <br /> <br />If the government was to add virus programs/spyware within those backout protocall the hacker /cyber offender would be locked red handed. Beaten at his or her own game. To catch them you have to hack them back. Which is something the government has issues doing. Though unless they unknowingly get caught with a spyware how will you bypass a spiderweb before they can just back out, light the computer on fire & move on? Which by the way is usualy how it works.<br /> <br />I think all ports for every network should be set to auto port scan everyone who try's to access that network. Passwords/user names are no longer safe. <br /> <br />Any hacker worth his salt can break a password/username if he or she is determined. <br /> <br />Create supreme matrix loaders for all programs/networks/ports. <br />Create thousands of ally ways millions of container loc's. <br /> <br />Add thousands of fake programs with false information many miss directives. <br /> <br />If these kinds of things are done on a grand scale you will create a huge diversion system. If A kid gets in and sees some data that looks good he'll grab it /scan it and back out before most can catch. <br /> <br />The governments only catches A VERY small percent of attacks. <br /> <br />This is a very fast process now. <br /> A government state outside the US could infiltrate many data center districts within the united states within mini seconds behind spider webs of "millions" of fake Ips /route locations and mac addresses. <br /> <br />With that being said why does the government not do the same thing? Hide your networks on soft-line networks with no outside directive protocall. <br />Behind millions of sub IPs sub false networks. Direct route lie standards. <br /> <br />The government in A sense needs to act in the mind-set of the cyber offender. <br /><br />These idea could be used to protect all national interest. From utility to governmental programs.<br /><br /> The person who is decided for this job, needs to be a real person in the media people can look at for safety.<br /><br /> A real figure, not just some person out to make A TON of money off our Tax dollars. He or she must really care for our national security.<br /> Pay him what a High School Principal would be paid these days which Is like 50-65 grand.<br />He or she must be at the beckon call of the President 24/7.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This is extremely important, I know some government agencies have already taken some of these steps.

They encourage cubbyhole thinking; democracy becomes a power struggle, between static ideas and we are left with inadequate solutions to pressing common problems. Establishing periodic Opinion Pools could help us broaden our vision, strengthen our individual opinions, allow us to hear each other and together, deal more effectively with our common problems.</div><br />	ted	9	10	1	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3917-4049	
3918-4049	LGBT Issues on the Obama Administration Website	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Obama's presidential campaign in 2008 effectively rallied unprecedented numbers of LGBT community members and allies who helped campaign for a new administration, hoping to secure the national recognition of important issues affecting LGBT peoples in America. Historically, societal problems against this community instigated by hate and misunderstanding, such as violence, sexual abuse, discrimination, and isolation, have been ignored by our government. However, as demonstrated by the large number of LGBT activists who helped campaign for our president, there is a growing movement for change as these issues are finally being discussed by our representatives. <br /><br />Unfortunately, there currently appears to be a backwards trend in this policy. The website for the Obama administration, which used to include LGBT concerns under the â&euro;&oelig;issuesâ&euro;? section, no longer addresses these concerns. This is alarming. The people who helped elect our president, many of whom are LGBT youth who regularly access the internet, are once again feeling ignored by our executive branch. As a representative of such youth and all LGBT community members, I hereby request that the administration return LGBT issues to its deserved place on the Obama website.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>LGBT community members have been ignored long enough by our executive branch. As a country built upon the ideas of democracy, individual freedom, and community, our governing administration should work towards representing all of the people of America.<br /><br />Furthermore, once again including issues which impact the LGBT community on the website will encourage a spirit of collaboration and open discussion, which will enrich our democracy.</div><br />	ninja_nerd	5	8	3	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3918-4049	
3920-4049	Website for tracking bills, senators, reps, etc.	2009-05-28 00:00:00	A web2.0 website people can log in to track bills they subscribe to. Being able to watch and monitor its progress as it goes through the process (e.g. the house, the senate, president's desk, etc) and being able to comment on it as it changes. Subscribing to bills and your local rep to see what they are up to, to make it easy to keep in touch with what is going on. This type of website could have a lot of value as features are added. Could be modelled after the facebook model. This would also have the benefit of bringing people and grassroots organizations together on similar issues.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Because we are super busy and some automation of the participatory process and easy access to bills and their content are necessary for a functioning government.</div><br />	badhack	11	11	0	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3920-4049	
3921-4049	Leverage National Assets Through Lease and or Sale	2009-05-28 00:00:00	The United States government should begin a process of to review and audit all non-essential national assets. The United States government holds in it's possession many artifacts and assets of high value in our national museum system and throughout hundreds of agencies that are not on display and/or of no use. <br /><br />Such items not on display should be evaluated and when possible the government should offer items for sale at auction. If a sale is not warranted a lease may be offered to reputable borrowers for a fair price.<br /><br />Artwork and artifacts not on display would then be viewed in some fashion rather than hidden away. Also the government can gain a substantial sum of money to help protect other artifacts or pay debts. <br /><br />The point is not to raise a mass sum of money but allow people access to artifacts not on display, a benefit of the program sould be a nice profit with no new taxes. Any sum will help lower our debts no matter how small.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Because it's a simple way to raise money from voluntarily without a tax increase, and allow people access to hidden treasures.</div><br />	breroth	-3	2	5	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3921-4049	
3922-4049	Revise Information Collection Request requirements to encourage feedback on collaboration in the field.	2009-05-28 00:00:00	The Paperwork Reduction Act requires approval by OMB of most government requests for information from people who are not in government. This can be a lengthy and cumbersome review process and tends to discourage agencies from seeking outside feedback from stakeholders and the public on the performance of public outreach and engagement efforts(be they meetings, hearings,dispute resolution efforts, consensus building, dialogues, etc). <br /><br />Not only should the Information Collection Request (ICR) procedures be streamlined, but there should be development of standard and tailorable performance evaluation tools for widespread use by agencies. These should be both paper and web-based evaluation tools.<br /><br />The U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution developed evaluation tools over several years in collaboration with other agencies and now those tools can be used with permission by multiple agencies to assess processes used for collaborative problem solving or resolution of environmental conflicts. The information gleaned from these evaluation data are useful for performance feedback to managers, contractors, and participants. It is also very helpful information at the case and aggregate level for training purposes. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>We need to evaluate the performance of open government actions as measured by those participating in such efforts as well as by third party assessors and internal agency managers. Without this information, we will not be able to improve or optimize our experiences and practice with open government and collaborative governance.</div><br />	Kirk Emerson	3	3	0	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3922-4049	
3923-4049	Sustainable Communities Can Produce Renewable Energy	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Among the many benefits of sustainable communities is the ability to create closed eco-systems that can manage resources capable of creating renewable energy. Sweden's EPA-equivalent puts ours to shame. They have developed an extremely comprehensive and thoughtful plan that looks at the environment in a holistic manner. One of the results of that is the way that municipal waste is managed. Each municipality owns and operates its own wastewater treatment facility and they are responsible for what they produce. The sludge that results from the wastewater treatment process is not shipped to other regions of the country; it's used by the municipality to create biofuel, syngas, and other renewable energy sources. Syngas can be used to generate enough energy to power the plants that create it. It can also be used as a component in the production of other biofuels. Homes are heated and powered by poo. Cars run on it. In fact, the government provides subsidies to those who fill up their tanks on the biofuel created from poo.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>This is such an important idea because, in this country, we lag behind the rest of the world in seeking ways to better use sludge. We're satisfied to spread it on our farmland and run the risk of contaminating our soil, water, and food. And, worst of all, municipal governments in many parts of the country are left powerless to ban its use on farmlands as a "fertilizer". The EPA's 503 rule presumed that state and local governments would adopt stricter regulations and laws, but states like mine, Pennsylvania, adopted the 503 rule wholesale as part of the state's ACRE law and municipalities that try to write their own tougher ordinances are threatened with lawsuits by the state's attorney general. It's absolutely backwards thinking on the part of the state. The Federal goverment should be working closely with state and municipal governments to make sure municipalities across the country are empowered to manage processes like converting sludge to fuel. Imagine a country where, not only are we using a really renewable energy source efficiently, but where we're generating our own power locally. But the municipalities need the Federal government to step in and declare it a priority.</div><br />	feridun	14	14	0	1	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3923-4049	
3924-4049	Promote diversity in communication strategies	2009-05-28 00:00:00	An additional open government principle might be: employ a diverse range of communications strategies to assure broad participation and effective engagement of diverse individuals, sectors and communities. <br /><br />This would include drawing on web-based tools, as well as other forms of media and information collection and exchange formats. It would also mean encouraging the use of diverse set of tools for meeting management, information display and analysis, and decision support technologies. Some commentors have already mentioned the need to integrate web-based outreach tools with face-to-face interactions. Not only are their language barriers and special needs populations to accommodate, but people have different learning and information processing styles that should be incorporated into communication strategies.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>The use of multiple communication strategies is essential for carrying out the open government principles of transparency, inclusion and fairness.</div><br />	Kirk Emerson	7	7	0	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3924-4049	
3925-4049	States Rights	2009-05-28 00:00:00	The Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, was ratified on December 15, 1791. The Tenth Amendment restates the Constitution's principle of Federalism by providing that powers not granted to the national government nor prohibited to the states are reserved to the states or the people.<br /><br />"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>We need to allow the people their basic rights. Many of the so-called "Hot Button issues" fall directly under this basic principle our country was founded upon. Why are we as a nation waiting on national politicians to stop being afraid to touch these issue, when the states want these powers back in the first place? If California wants to allow or forbid one of these issues while South Carolina is against it why shouldn't they be able to make those decisions for themselves without having to worry about if the federal government is going to overstep their power to prevent the peoples will?</div><br />	bperrydore	0	3	3	2	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3925-4049	
3926-4049	Standardize sub-agency website format within the same agency 	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Each local office in a single agency should have similar over arching formats. If two offices in a single agency produce the same type of data then you should be able to get to this data in the same manner on each office's site. This format should allow for individual office customization for data that is unique to an individual office.<br /><br />US Forest Service is good with this. Each national forest has a site with similar navigation to another national forest. It is easy to find the same type of data for each forest. Look for camping information on these sites. Just go to "recreational activities" --> "camping"<br />Ex:<br />http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/carson/<br />http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/angeles/<br /><br /><br />US Fish and wildlife service is not good. There is a different navigation for each site making it hard to find the same type of data from different offices sites. Try to find biological opinions on both of these sites. They are in unique spots on each office's site. <br />Ex.<br />http://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/Oklahoma/<br />http://www.fws.gov/verobeach/<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>Ease of finding data/information between agencies.</div><br />	alesmith56	4	4	0	0	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3926-4049	
3928-4049	Cannabis regulation and legalization	2009-05-28 00:00:00	Americans who will be smoking cannabis won't be the only reason there will be extra revenue. Yes there will be an extra 13+ billion in extra revenue, but also all the freed up prisons would save billions. All the money going to fighting this pointless war, will save billions. Hemp will bring in millions of jobs and billions of dollars in the clothing, fuel, textile, paper, and housing industry. Alcohol, tobacco, and generic prescription drugs are far more harmful than cannabis, and smoking it isn't the only way to go about it. On that argument people who smoke cannabis smoke nearly 1/30th of the amount cigarette smokers use. Not only are all of these points true, but drug carels would CRIPPLE with 65%+ of their business gone. Marijuana law reform is no longer a political liability, it's a political opportunity<br /><br /> <br /><br />Why Is This Idea Important?<br /><br /><div>It'll bring in millions of jobs and billions of dollars, as well as saving thousands of lifes from cartels and alcohol dependency. </div><br />	akkin918	24	26	2	4	http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3928-4049

They thought the idea was plausible.<br /><br />Anyway I think the feasibility of this idea & technology to locate and defeat IEDs should be considered and investigated to help the warfighter completely defeat the IDE threat. <br /><br />Basically an IED sensor would be placed on a UAV sniffing for IED compounds (copper, explosives, mercury etc... then place a GPS corrodinate on that site to either avoid and or difuse.<br /><br />Please check it out.
