It increases intuitive awareness of danger, errors, and best action. Physics explains why it reduces accidents and error 98%-99.7%. <br/>Energy Healing is Applied Physics, validated by 42 studies. Corrects all distortions in the Life Energy Field, Aura, aiding health, safety training, and life.

Physics explains why these tools are effective. How many of the “Nuts” you hear from and discount are advising on Geniuses info that cultures still discount and suppress?  Physics applies to everything, even us. Geniuses info is discounted and ignored for two to hundreds of generations, sometimes thousands. This is costly and very damaging to all cultures and to long term human survival.<br/>➤Challenge. Can you cease assuming that any establishment info is accurate?  When people are involved, it often isn’t. Greed, arrogance, stupidity, education errors, cultural blind spots+<br/>We propose that directors, officers, and editors do something unusual to benefit humanity which will also correct internal management errors, offer many new and expanded business opportunities, and improve your profitability. Start with the obvious. ➤Physics proved our universe is a MultiDimensional Holographic SubSystem. We, Earth, and all we deal with are Completely Integrated Fully Interrelated MultiDimensional Holographic SubSystems of our Universe.  ➤Instrumentation shows Acupuncture Points, Meridian Lines, and Chakras. Study why our best universities and firms ignore 37+ studies of Natural Healing System Vegetarian Diet Prevention saving 56% to 68% of health costs, reducing illnesses 76% to 83%. This will reduce retirement and employee costs. Media, even NYT Jane Brody, promote malnutrition, ignoring research on biological nutrition, with 56% to 68% cost savings on Vegetarian Diet Healing and Prevention, 76%-83% less illness. Why??? ➤US Govt says to use all whole grains. White bread is proven to cause two health problems. The lack of 26 nutrients missing from white flour and 19 from white rice are proven to injure health in many ways, directly involved in many health problems. None or very little sugar, low salt, no junk food. Tax all junk and non foods $10-$30. Per Pound or Item to improve health and to recover costs to taxpayers of health problems caused by malnutrition. Junk foods are deadly. Why promote illness, death?<br/>	➤Sane cultures will use Prevention on all problems. Most Humans Don’t. I ask that you assume that Geniuses in all fields are right, examine the research, evidence sources, and references on the forefront of science and human knowledge conflicting with beliefs. Sociology Cultural Psychology and history show why and how we ignore new discoveries and info. We still shoot Whistle Blowers even in the hard sciences and in seeking solutions for problems. There are 428+ books by historians on how establishments shoot innovators and whistle blowers, today as throughout history. We are the same people now.➤Examine the 46 scientific discoveries that created major Paradigm Shifts, the Forefront of Science, Physics, Sociology, Weather Change Research, Education, Training, Biology, Holistic Health, Healing Victim’s Body Mind Systems, Safety, Prevention of Rape, Violence, Crime, Murder, Greed, Vested Interest Pressures and Distortions. Results will surprise you.  Geniuses are almost always right, yet Sociology finds are ignored for two to hundreds of generations.<br/>	➤Twenty five studies validate Holistic Health, saving 80%. Read the 1997 President’s Health Committee 23 person Holistic Health study reporting ➤“Holistic Health Is Valid. Integrate All Holistic Health Healing Modalities to Save Lives, Suffering, and Billions”. I talked with them. This report was suppressed. Who suppressed it?  Why??? ➤This is a major crime.<br/>	➤Examine why you’ve missed evidence in so many fields proving establishments info false or distorted. ➤USA officials put info on serious errors and actual crimes under Secret or Executive Privilege to hide illegal actions and their major or embarrassing goofs. Pass laws making these coverups very serious Felonies, with mandatory very long jail sentences.  ➤➤President Jimmy Carter writes that USA Bush Government used 50+ designations to restrict unclassified information, created 81%<br/> more secrets in 2005 then in 2000, reported by www.OpenTheGovernment.org. <br/>	Our summary of geniuses info indicates 23 + Pulitzer Prize stories. ➤The Union Of Concerned Scientists Web Page reports show Bush acted illegally.

Said “Abstinence is the only way to prevent STD’s and pregnancy”. This is proven to raise pregnancy and STD rates considerably. ➤HHS fails to Use Eleven Elements of the New Scientific Method Physics requires, systems research, accident and error prevention training, ignores and suppresses 25 Studies Validating Holistic Health, with 80% savings and abilities to heal all problems. US Government was paid under the table for 82 years to eliminate MD’s competitors and put MD’s in full charge of US “Health Care” systems. MD Illness Care Is Not Health Care. MD’s are Pharmaceutical Shills. Study why NY Times reporters and editors suppressed all of this info. Many told NYT and most media about it. Do major expose’s on Educator’s, governments, and media’s many very damaging failures. Media have been told about the 212+ books on the 1838 ongoing MD war against Alternative Medicine.  Ignored. <br/>	➤Zoology Research proved by 1999 that over 450 species have homosexuals. It’s illegal to not allow marriage for gays and lesbians. Religions and non profits lying about gays and lesbians, killing many, must lose their tax exemptions under IRS regulations. They must forfeit all business and professional licenses! All involved are actively promoting violence and murder, and actively aiding and abetting suicide. All Individuals and Groups involved are Guilty of Crimes.➤FIRST Amendment outlaws laws against stem cell research, abortion, and any homosexual marriage or other activities.<br/>➤Government Elected and Hired Officials have no immunity for actions aiding and promoting murder by lying about homosexuals, Health Care, suppressing Holistic Health Healing, Prevention, not requiring safety training that reduces accidents and errors 98%-99.7%, increasing creativity, violence prevention tools, and overpopulation past farmland’s ability to feed them, destroying ecological systems. This causes starvation. One+ Billion will starve by 2100, Six Billion by 2140. Overpopulation is the major factor in violence, war, and destruction of ecological systems. These actions and inactions are manslaughter and genocide. Management, Educators, Governments, and Editors fail to be truthful.<br/>       ➤Military and State Dept. Ignored Cultural Psychology Research on Islamic Societies,  safety training that eliminates 98% to 99.7% of accidents and errors, Holistic Health validation, regeneration feasibility, scientific devices that eliminate pests, improve health, safety, solve problems, aid R & D projects, plus much else. <br/>➤➤➤Add a Holistic Health Editor and writers.

The history of the race and the history of science show inherent habits of suppressing and discounting innovation, often killing the innovator. Dr Joseph Lister noted that “Asepsis is important”. He was ostracized. Western hospitals then were far more deadly then home care and home birth.

Education’s many failures are proven by our graduates making all  the decisions and taking the actions that have created our many and increasing problems. They continue to make problems far worse. None ‘Just Happened’ by accident. ➤Somebody ‘Out There’ didn’t step in and create these many problems. Graduates from schools created almost all of humanities problems. Let’s fix educations errors, omissions.<br/>	Why haven’t home and property owners, educators, and media yelled about IRS taxing Illusionary Profits in the sale of any asset. Unless the purchase price is adjusted to current real dollars, taxes are paid on currency depreciation caused by government policies and other events. Homes bought for $100,000, sold years later for $300,000, may have cost in terms of today’s real dollars $200,000 to $400,000. It seems illegal to tax non existent money, even very real losses. Why do Business Schools flunk thinking in so many areas, ignoring science, sociology, and the many lessons in the history of human error, greed, stupidity, and arrogance???<br/>	➤We still work on symptoms instead of the actual basic causes of each problem. ➤We ignore systems interrelationships.  We often fail to identify all of the interrelated basic causes of our major social problems.  ➤We fail to hold our educators, governments, corporations, and all other institutions liable for their damaging and often deadly errors, omissions, and fantasies.

As CO2 in oceans and lakes continues to increase, acidity will destroy phytoplankton’s ability to form shells with calcium. They feed the zooplankton that feed fish. This will wipe out the foundation for the ocean’s food chain. The current rate of increase of CO2 will result in fish being substantially gone in the relativity near future, 2300's?. ➤It is most urgent to genetically redesign phytoplankton for high CO2 levels. Atmospheric CO2 is still increasing rapidly from humans activities.  CO2 dissolves in oceans, lakes, and streams.  No fish soon.<br/>➤Do the genetic redesign needed for coral to survive at higher and lower temperatures.<br/>Methane releases from tundra, rice fields, cows, and human activities make warming far worse.	➤Food production reduction by weather changes and no oil, plus overpopulation, creates the most urgent emergencies of the eight major disasters facing  humanity. Plan ahead??? <br/>Or starve six billion by 2140?  Anti abortion anti birth control killed half of the 19 million starved since 1893, and will kill One + Billion by 2100, Six Billion by 2140. We act to make this worse.<br/>The Gulf Stream is slowing, and may stop bringing warmth to Atlantic basin agriculture, reducing  crop yields drastically for all Atlantic basin areas   ➤Weather Changes are reducing crops drastically by creating far worse crop conditions then Earth has had for eons. This becomes far more disastrous with no oil for agriculture by 2100. ➤➤➤Melting of tundra far more rapidly then expected, releasing vast stores of Methane, may possibly? create a feedback loop, melting tundra at increasing rates, speeding global warming. There is a potential of complete catastrophe for life on Earth. <br/>	This cycle happened twice before, destroying 94% of life on Earth. This methane release feedback loop speeding Earth’s heating may, at some point, be irreversible. Rice field bacteria produce 1/3 of the methane, tundra melt 1/3, cows 1/5.

Use physics based research to solve weather control, proven feasible by projects in Britanin, develop devices to eliminate fires from a distance, and eliminate toxins or radiation from any area. ➤➤Physics indicates we may be able to develop new power sources from the underlying structure of matter within 40-60 years and $1.8 trillion max. Start this now, as it may take longer to succeed. This may be the only viable long term solution to energy needs. No more oil very soon. ‘They’ aren’t making any more.  ➤We solved nuclear power and bombs with 1938-44 science. The spinoffs in new science development will pay for the energy project, and solve many other problems by creating the foundation for the next two levels of basic science needed to work with MultiDimensional Holographic SubSystems. <br/>➤Physics and other sciences indicate that these projects are all scientifically feasible, IF we work with all of our Completely Interrelated, Integrated Holographic SubSystem.  Physics opens possibilities to solve hundreds of science and engineering projects we can’t address with mechanistic mind sets. Let’s use Science 2009.<br/>BASIC CAUSES OF 9-11 GOOFS STILL IGNORED–CULTURAL BLIND SPOT RESEARCH<br/>	I offer info and services to enable your using the forefront of science and knowledge to increase effectiveness and reduce errors. Security and cultures are ignoring research in many fields.  Workshops on the Forefront of Science and Knowledge will bring together the geniuses in each field to teach all key people and staffs an overview and understanding of the forefront of science and all knowledge. This is Mandatary to break human’s inherent habit of discounting any new to them info that conflicts with the actual inherent Mind Set of people and establishments. Why report AS IF 1800's info on science, sociology, and history is true???  Media will increase circulation IF they report honestly on Geniuses info. See article Security 9-11 and other Security, Govt + articles on SA web.<br/>	➤Establishments and investigative groups are still ignoring the key factors in 9-11, the Challenger loss, dike failures, WW2 12-7-41 radar failure to warn of Hawaii bombing, and all other failures to examine and use all applicable needed info to prevent and solve problems. <br/>➤This is always the inherent human habit of Psychologically Discounting any new info that conflicts with expected patterns. This is aided by greed, arrogance, payoffs, the Good Old Boy’s Network, stupidity, and the Bigotry Against and Suppression of Geniuses that is designed in to human cultures. ➤Each language has inherent world views and basic assumptions designed into languages. Language, Education, Culture, Religion, and Histories of each culture affect attitudes, emotions, world view, concepts, war, violence, women’s issues, and actions. <br/>	➤Sociology Cultural Psychology research proved that Cultural Conditioning is hypnotic in character, and is the major factor in human gullibility, disasters, errors, war, crime, rape, violence. This Is Why Advertising Works.<br/>➤➤➤Therefore Only 4.6% of people can even consider new to them info that conflicts with Their Mind Set.  This inherent habit makes ads effective. ➤Training in awareness of and how to override what Cultural Psychologists call the Vested Interests Syndrome is needed by all leaders, educators, governments, security, staff, adults, children, and cultures everywhere. <br/>	Help to aid and protect health, security, safety, military, pilots, ATC, drivers, parents, and kids. ➤Ignoring our geniuses findings in Cultural Psychology, sociology, science, history, climate, crops, the effects of language, religion, education, and culture on world view and actions, and major research on cultural blind spots is arrogant, short sighted, and very expensive. Governments, State Department, FBI, CIA, DOD, corporations, media, and educators need all science info, and research on training that drops accidents 98% to 99.7%, errors 96% to 99%, and Use NeuroLinguistic Programming  Imagery to permanently eliminate stress internalization in one 5-10 hour day.<br/>➤Training increases the intuitive awareness of danger, error, best action, creativity, and the rate of invention. This will increase the ability of all in military, education, government, and media to avoid most attacks, bombs, guns, and accidents, get the blood off the highways, and make children far safer. ➤Safety research proved “No One Has An Accident by Accident”. Inattention, distraction, stress, pharmaceuticals, drugs, and alcohol are major causes. ➤➤Finland almost completely eliminated alcohol from drivers. We can do this here. Driving Drunk is attempted murder. Charge all drunk drivers for trying to kill people. Research proves Holistic Health Drug Rehabilitation & Prevention Systems will get 99%+ permanent rehabilitation on all addictions: pharmaceuticals, hard drugs, food, tobacco, alcohol, even socially damaging behavior and criminal habits.<br/>	➤Why not use all of science? Injured and ill military, agents, families, and all people can be healed quickly with Holistic Health Sciences, even head and spinal cord injuries, yet this info on Energy Medicine as Applied Physics, validated by 42 recent studies and 5,000 years of use history is withheld from security agents, families, sports players, schools, military, media, Justice Department, and cultures. All involved in any sport need the safety training to prevent injuries, and Holistic Health Healing to heal all injured in any sport.“MD Incurable” injuries can all  be healed. ➤➤FBI management, agents, US Attorney, DoD, and elected officals refused to examine evidence of safety and error reduction training that will increase agent effectiveness and their ability to deal with Holographic SubSystems, enable avoiding detection in covert work, and the ongoing major crimes in MD Allopathic Medicine’s 1838 to present war against science in health care, their 1838 ongoing fascist suppression of Alternative Medicine, Holistic Health, Natural Healing System Vegetarian Diet Healing and Prevention, Herbal Medicine, Yoga, the Interrelationships of Mind Body Environment. ➤Physics proved bodies are mind stuff, literally part of the mind. ➤MD’s paid Congress under the table for 82 years to be in charge of all health care and eliminate all competition. There are 212+ books on this ongoing war. Expose it and stop it. This is theft by deception, criminal malfeasance,  torture, manslaughter, and RICO. In 1987 AMA was found guilty of conspiracy, restraint of trade, and anti trust, lost their appeal. ➤11 smarter MD groups settled out of court.<br/>	➤Serious negligence in security training is still ignored. They miss Sociologist’s Cultural Psychology research on each culture, the effects of history, language, religion, subculture, culture, and education on emotions, attitudes, world view, and their probable actions.<br/>Understanding geniuses research needs all of this info and more. We sent data to DoD, media, government, and educators since 1975.<br/>Discounting proven new info is anti security.<br/>➤➤We gave this info to DoD’s Chief of Staff Colin Powell and FBI agent Moss in 1992, and many others since. None bothered to check references, talk with researchers, and examine evidence. ➤Always Examine who disagrees with establishments and why. The Good Old Boy Network is alive, well, and very damaging. <br/>➤Address all of the interrelated major factors involved in our massive failure to develop fully democratic, responsible, responsive, intelligent, caring governments and firms that plan ahead for ten thousand years in all actions who work with entire Interrelated Holographic SubSystems to gain best results for all people and ecologies..<br/>➤All decisions and actions need to create the best possible outcome for children, adults, and environment in the long term. We still fail to act, even in the face of our experience that the design of most government systems requires elected officials to raise massive amounts of money for elections.  This results in them acting in favor of establishment contributors, and against the best interests of people, ecologies, the actual needs of people, society, and long term human survival.  Examine the evidence on political sellouts throughout our history reported in 783+ books, and the major sellouts today in health, safety, education, agriculture, violence, crime, justice systems design, and in handling info, ignoring problem prevention, definition, actual causes, interrelationships, systems, and valid scientifically based solutions. Leaders, their key people, and staffs all fail to consider or verify Whistle Blowers and University info. There are 428 histories on establishments shooting down innovators and whistle blowers, often literally.  Major sellouts were shown by the failure to examine and act on the President’s Health Committee 23 person Holistic Health study 1997  report “Holistic Health is valid, Integrate It, Save Lives, Suffering, Billions”. Neither Clinton nor the public was told that they had the info on curing 99%+ of breast and skin cancer, vision, stress, AIDS, and all other mind body health problems of any nature. I talked with them. The report was suppressed. Why? ➤➤Who did it? Who ordered it ignored to suppress science in health care??? Greed?<br/>➤Pharmaceutical MD money buys votes. MD’s running the Health Committee suppressed the Holistic Health study results. Brain washing works. Payoffs help. MD systems. MD  schools all promote pills, not science. Drugs are seldom needed. We can heal both problems and causes. There are five types of payoffs now. Use Herbs and all elements of Alternative Medicine.<br/>	Examine our summaries of geniuses info, security, safety,  military, and other proposals.<br/> Education still has 22 errors, omissions, and fantasies. Agriculture and weather cycle studies find that Earth will only be able to feed one billion people in the 2100's, even IF we develop new power sources from the underlying structure of matter. Physics and other research indicates this is feasible. Oil is gone by 2100. ➤➤➤Earth can only support 500 million without oil. Fuels are used by Agriculture. Can’t grow fuel and food. Both require crop land and fuel. Do corn bio fuels use 1.29 gallons of oil to produce and deliver one gallon of bio fuel, only 70% as powerful???<br/>➤All structures must be built for very low energy use. Straw bale construction, triple glazed windows, fireproof construction, and solar panels are urgently needed. Fossil fuel availability is decreasing rapidly. Ergonomic design, low maintenance design, lightning rods, fireproof construction, and very low energy use is less costly over the life of buildings. Saves money on insurance and saves lives. Not requiring this kills some people.<br/>	➤Home and Business  Insurance Firms Violate Deceptive Practices Act When They Fail to Cover Full Replacement Value. Why no criminal charges??? Do we need more laws, or are we failing to apply current laws???<br/>	IRS seems to act illegally when they tax property sales without adjusting purchase price to the dollars current value. Isn’t it illegal to tax nonexistent profit of depreciated dollars?<br/>➤Promote Solar Panel efficiency research. National and international building codes are important. Psychotronic devices from many firms like Pyradyne Inc in LA will make all buildings and areas more livable. ➤Buy Pyradyne’s Laser OmniOrb, with 163 times the energy of a standard pyramid, demonstrate for all your people, use for research . Get prices from them, order through us, check made out to them, and we get credit. ➤➤They and others make Medallions that eliminate Jet Lag. No Jet Lag is important to all travelers and government. Yet Media, DOD, State, Educators ignore device research and Physics. “Science, What’s That?” attitude is very damaging and costly. <br/>	We need to plan ahead in all fields. ➤➤➤Farms use oil. ➤How many people can Earth feed without good crop weather and fuel? ➤Perhaps 500 Million IF We Rebuild Ecologies we depended on throughout human history..  Earth’s Population in 200 AD Is All Earth Can Support with weather changes and no oil.  Talk with Prof Milton Searle, UCSD Biology Dept.<br/> ➤Get George Kuepper’s 2006 report on Radionic and Tower devices, SA web Ag.. Appropriate Technology Transfer For Rural Areas, 16,000 farmers, and USN research in 1984 report “Radionic Devices Eliminate All Insect Pests, Viruses, Bacteria, Fungus, and Mold from any target area, using different frequencies for each item”. Saves farmer’s budgets 17%-22%+, keeps toxins out of food and environment, saves farm workers lives, and improves health for everyone. They increase soil fertility. They will remove any insect pest, bacteria, viruses, fungus, and mold from commercial buildings, houses, hospitals+. Make soils more fertile. No fertilizers or poisons. Use after floods and storms. ➤Tower Devices make plants and animals healthier and calmer in a 2,500 acre area, reducing farm birth defects 98.4%. Pregnant women near a Tower for nine months will tend to be free of birth defects. Place these throughout all cities. These devices are ignored, suppressed, as they are only explained by Quantum Physics. ➤Radionic Devices will eliminate all biowarfare agents, yet DoD fails to study them. Military has eight major errors, 23 altogether. We’ve mailed Joint Chiefs, DoD, and State Dept since 1992. General Powell received our material in 1992. Didn’t respond to mail or phone calls. ➤FDA closed two firms for daring to state that Radionics eliminates viruses and bacteria. D.C. Post Office needs these now.<br/>	We urgently need to require that all elected, appointed, and hired key people, decision makers, researchers,. and their staffs have a high IQ, Mensa level or more, and the ability to pass a test on the forefront of science, history, sociology, human knowledge, all of the interrelationships in science and knowledge, and the  implications of systems research, physics proof that all we deal with, and us, are Completely Integrated, Interrelated MultiDimensional Holographic SubSystems of a MultiDimensional Holographic Universe, Cost Benefit Analysis, Cause Effect Studies, and Long Term Effects of Actions.. This is urgent for all school and university boards, media, corporations, security, government officials, staffs, politicians, kids, and all people. Our Holographic Universe requires Eleven Elements of the New Scientific Method, and often Four Design of Experiment Modalities to be scientific.  ➤➤Optimum decisions can’t be made on a badly GIGO’d data base.  Geniuses data at the forefront of science and knowledge is needed by all involved in decisions, education, information handling, children, cultures, research, and life. Earth can’t afford decisions made with ignorance of accurate data, or to please Vested Interests, greed, and power.<br/> GIGO’d info is costly and deadly.<br/>	➤World Peace and World Health are feasible Only IF we correct all 22 errors in education world wide, and use all of the info geniuses have developed for all planning, raising children, education, and all actions. <br/>	We can increase creativity, reduce populations rapidly, eliminate violence and actions against people and Earth, yet we make no effort to apply geniuses info that will make sane survivable societies feasible.<br/>➤➤When all leaders know we face eight possible and probable disasters, learn what our geniuses have discovered, and how very damaging actions based on false info are, many will change their destructive habits of thought and action. Some will renounce war to act for human survival. Business and cultures act to make destruction of ecologies and weather changes far worse. There are 32 studies of training that reduces accidents and errors 98% to 99.7% by increasing intuitive awareness of errors, best action, and danger. They avoid danger and errors. The study groups work with Yoga, Tai Chi, Meditation, and Aikido. Studies have been reported in our literature since 1938, every paper 7-87, an AP story on the 32nd study.  ➤Failure to require this training for all drivers, pilots, parents, children, espionage, military, security, firemen, and leaders results in many avoidable deaths and injuries. Training reduces violence in schools, families, and cultures, increasing creativity and rates of invention. <br/>	➤Governments, both elected and hired officials, HHS, DoD, corporations, Homeland Security, educators, media, corporations, HR management, and all staffs  are involved in these ongoing crimes.<br/>	➤The scientific method requires questioning all assumptions. Read “Education Scientific Method, Eleven Elements”. Four Design of Experiment Tools Often Necessary to be Scientific. Study all SA articles and evidence.<br/>➤False Assumptions are dangerous and very expensive. Always ask who disagrees with establishments and why. They are often, not always, right. Examine all of the evidence far more  carefully when it conflicts with your belief system. Check evidence, references. <br/>	➤Let’s correct all of the actual basic causes of our many problems and apply the forefront of science and knowledge in all areas of life and human survival! <br/>➤Stop the extremely damaging Discrimination, Discount, and Bigotry Against Geniuses and Their Discoveries. Promote very long term planning ahead for thousands of years. Examine Effects of Actions Over Ten Centuries and Over Eons. ➤Promote effective systems planning ahead in all that we do for at least 100,000 years. Act AS IF humanity was going to live on Earth for more then a few years. <br/>Why continue to act to destroy humanities’ increasingly small chance of survival???<br/>➤➤Call me re receipt, references, and actions planned.  ➤Encourage Whistle Blowing. <br/>➤Help create a major nonprofit to offer rewards, protection, better jobs, education, and relocation if needed, for all who identify problems and coverups in our culture and world. Publicize the five types of payoffs rampant in our culture and world, the damage done by the Good Old Boys Network, and how both act against babies, children, women, families, men, cultures, ecology, and both short and long term human ecological survival. Require criminal penalties against all who act against people and long term survival. We are far past any possibility of comfortable human survival.<br/>➤Does any religion’s teaching say to promote starvation and war by pushing overpopulation and destroying ecological systems??? Or to kill women by forcing pregnancy and birth??? Or to ignore and lie about health, healing, and prevention tools???<br/>	➤➤➤GIGO’d information systems are very costly of lives and wealth. Decisions based on false or distorted info wastes lives and money.  We have destroyed ecological systems at an increasing rate, do even worse each year. <br/>➤We are out of oil before 2100. <br/>➤Emphasize that science keeps proving ‘What We Absolutely Know Is So’ is quite incorrect, and what happens when establishments are caught in serious errors, omissions, fantasies, and fraud.  ➤➤Teach how and why Matriarchal Cultures are far more effective in meeting the needs of children, families, adults, ecologies, and long term survival. They always do far better at seeing the complete system, all details, planning for all needs, planning for the future. ➤➤➤If you want jobs done right, hire women.  ➤Will humans reduce world population 93% to 500 million, or starve six billion by 2140??? <br/>➤We must rebuild ecologies rapidly to support even 500 million next century.<br/>	➤We are very far past any possibility of comfortable human and ecological survival.<br/>Our best universities prove unable to examine research or listen to professors proving errors. Cross disciplinary education is urgent, as all departments info applies to all others. Physics, Sociology, and History clarify major errors. Science enables many opportunities for research, health, healing, and problem solving not feasible with the proven false mechanistic concepts.<br/>Graduates lack basic info on the implications of Holographic MultiDimensional SubSystems, Systems research, cause effect relationships, cost benefit analysis, the many lessons of history, how Science keeps proving wrong what we absolutely know is so, why Geniuses new information is ignored for two to hundreds, sometimes thousands of generations, when it conflicts with Basic Beliefs, why Mind Set takes precedence over new scientific information and research, and both how and why we take many generations to act on new to us info. There are 428+ books by historians on establishment habit of shooting innovators and whistle blowers, today as throughout history. We are still the same biologically designed people, all but 4.6% unable to even consider new info that conflicts with their beliefs, their Mind Set!!! This is inherent in the biological design of ALL SPECIES, literally designed in to all humans. ➤➤We evolved in tribal cultures. We still think and act with tribal attitudes and responses.<br/>	Why do you feel you have to keep proving that Sociologists are correct by refusing to examine evidence, research, science, sociology, and history???   Geniuses exist in universities and throughout all cultures. Why ignore their findings??? Addre
