  [UPDATE 5/29: In the spirit of collaborative decision making, this lengthy proposal should be viewed as a theme, and alterations to details suggested.  The most commonly proposed alteration suggested so far is eliminating the proposal to eliminate the Senate, and I am leaning toward doing so.  Other changes can be proposed too.]<br/><br/>Leave the White House less imperial than you found it.  Prosecute Bush, Cheney, and their top officials in order to deter in the future the crimes of aggressive war, misleading congress, defrauding congress, misspending funds, war crimes, murder, warrantless spying, torture, domestic propaganda, violations of the Hatch Act and the Voting Rights Act, obstruction of justice, misprision of felony, retaliating against whistleblowers, etc.  Restore to Congress the power to legislate, the power to begin and end wars, the power to raise and spend money, the power to approve or reject treaties and appointments, and the power to oversee the functioning of the federal government including through the power of impeachment and the power of inherent contempt.  That means no more signing statements rewriting laws, and instead support for legislation that would criminalize such behavior.  And it means similar action on each of the other offenses.  <br/><br/>We, the people, must:<br/><br/>Demand that Congress ban the use of funds for any activities created in violation of the law by presidential signing statements.<br/><br/>Amend the Constitution to clearly ban the use of presidential pardons to pardon crimes authorized by the president.<br/><br/>Amend the War Powers Act and the Constition to include the requirement that Congressional authorizations of war include time limits of no more than 12 months, after which Congress must vote again to extend the war or end it, to disallow the unconstitutional initiation of wars without Congressional approval, and to make the law enforceable.<br/><br/>Make war profiteering by any war maker a major felony. This would apply to any employee of the federal government or anyone who had within the past decade been an employee of the federal government.<br/><br/>Legislate a requirement that, in any war, the military aged children and grandchildren of the president, the vice president, all cabinet officials, and all Congress members serve on the front lines in the most dangerous combat positions -- no exceptions, no exemptions.<br/><br/>Prohibit the use of mercenaries or any armed contractors, as well as the use of any military force on American soil except when directly engaged in defensive war against a foreign nation.<br/><br/>Repeal the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, the Military Commissions Act of 2006, the 2008 FISA Amendments Act, the Protect America Act, the original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and the PATRIOT Act.<br/><br/>Ban secret budgets, secret laws, and secret agencies.<br/><br/>Change the Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster.<br/><br/>Amend the Constitution to eliminate the Senate. [UPDATE: Let's clarify that you can support this general proposal without taking a position on this item, which is new to many people.  Explanation posted below.*]<br/><br/>End all rendition, as distinct from extradition.<br/><br/>Amend the Constitution to make the ban on ex-post-facto laws include any laws that would retroactively grant immunity for crimes.<br/><br/>Amend the Constitution to bar the vice president from exercising executive power.<br/><br/>Amend the Constitution to clarify the congressional power of inherent contempt.<br/><br/>Amend the Constitution to include the right to vote and to have one's vote counted publicly at the polling place.<br/><br/>Give Washington, D.C., full voting representation in Congress.<br/><br/>Amend the Constitution to ban private financing of campaigns, create public financing, and provide free air time to candidates.<br/><br/>Sign and ratify the Rome treaty to join the International Criminal Court.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>OPTIONAL PART 2 OF THIS PROPOSAL - Drafted and withheld at first, posted May 29th in response to useful comments from ttahiti and many others posted below.<br/><br/>Release more evidence, and support organizations suing in court for the release of evidence.  <br/><br/>Ask Congress to update and reissue the subpoenas that were refused during the 110th Congress, and to enforce them through inherent contempt.   <br/><br/>Support media reform and independent media outlets.  Break up the monopolies.  Invest in public media, including an E-Span election network to provide free substantive election coverage.<br/><br/>Advance a long-term vision in which the corrupting influences of money, media, and party are restrained, and our rights are restored, enforced, and expanded, including the right to vote and to have our votes counted publicly and locally, equal rights for all, environmental rights, the right to education and healthcare, worker rights, the right to basic welfare, freedom of press, freedom from war lies, and the right to know your rights.  <br/><br/>Push for approval, ratification, and enforcement of international human rights treaties.  Build toward Constitutional amendments or a convention with a plan to establish the right to know the laws and to have them applied equally, a ban on signing statements, whistleblowers protected, inherent contempt established, corporations stripped of human rights, monopolies restricted, clean campaign money and free media created, the power of parties reduced, nonpartisan (not bipartisan) redistricting, limiting election seasons, no more electoral college, a bigger House with no Senate, the right to be represented, no appointing of senators, limiting terms for judges, requiring a balanced budget, limiting bills to single topics and requiring clarity, allowing legislation by public initiative, allowing recall elections, creating citizen assemblies, and developing a fourth (people's) branch of government.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>*Explanation of proposal to eliminate the Senate: Many people have asked me why in the world we would eliminate the Senate, as if the idea were completely new.  It is not originial to me, and given the efforts that activists spend every year trying to pass legislation that's bad enough for the House but not bad enough for the Senate, I'm surprised it's new to anyone.  The House tried to end slavery 8 times.  The role of the Senate was intended to be and has been the blocking of popular proposals from the House.  The House is long overdue for being enlarged, not to mention reformed, but the Senate serves no purpose that cannot be better served by the House alone.  On every issue, the House is closer to majority opinion than the Senate is.  The Senate is not just more corrupted by money.  It also over-represents small states, so that one senator represents a half million people but another has to represent 17 million people -- neither task being remotely possible.  This is also why small states draw a disproportionate share of public services.  The only defense of the Senate is, in fact, that it represents the particular interests of small states, and yet while senators are much more supportive than House members of illegal spying, campaign bribery, war profiteering, union busting, torture, environmental destruction, private health insurance, and super-militarism, the same cannot be said of the residents of small states as compared to the residents of large states.  Senators are also more supportive than House members of measures that strip state governments of power.  Again, you don't need to support the elimination of the Senate to back this proposal and vote it up, but I hope to have answered the bewildered questions and possibly addressed the proposals to enlarge the Senate.  Let's end it, not mend it.

      Count on a lot of negative votes from the drones monitoring this.  The "closed circle" around tyhe imperial presidency probably fought against this forum, and then did everything they could to minimize its use: Memorial Day week-end, no federal employee announcement, no real publicity nation side.....<br/><br/>I support this idea and hope that active citizens will overpower the drones that are voting against good valid ideas such as this one.

      I don't know that there is a chance in hell of having the children of our leaders serve on the front lines... but it surely would be an 'equitable' solution, one that would diminish this desire to wage war on everyone.<br/>About the Senate... why not?

      Stop illegal preemptive racist genocidal wars. These wars are wrong. They do not protect Americans' freedom. They endanger our freedoms. Veterans like Matthew Alexander, the senior military interrogator for the task force that tracked down Abu Musab al-Zarqawi testified to these facts (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfYov5o5_2s).<br/><br/>Veterans continually protest that these wars are for profiteering corporations. They don't know what they were figjhting for. Afghnaistan is another Vietnam as Andrew bacevich has tesified to Congress.<br/><br/>See the facts: http://stopwar.lafilmonline.com

      Well, first of all, you do realize that it was Barack Obama that we elected, don't you?<br/>I would love to have been able to have voted for Dennis Kucinich, but unfortunately it didn't work out that way.<br/>You're trying to draw milk from a horse. <br/><br/>One of the things we on the Left always allow to trip us out is impatience. Did you honestly think our agenda would reach it's goals in the first year of a Democratic Centrist President's tenure?<br/>Achieving these goals is a long term effort that requires a lifetime of commitment. Barack Obama is not the answer, but he can get things started for the next, more Liberal leader. And he's doing exactly that.<br/>A foundation to build on. And if we continue to vote for "change", regardless of the candidate who offers it, we will make progress. But it won't be all happy happy joy joy over night.<br/><br/>It's going to take more than just a President to enact such reform, it takes a congress void of Republicans and Blue Dogs and we don't have that. Not yet anyway.<br/><br/>Not a bad list, needs careful refinement. Dump the "eliminate the Senate" stuff.<br/><br/>ICC? Susan Rice already stated the administration's willingness to be involved.<br/><br/>If we amend the Constitution to bar the vice president from exercising executive power who would lead if the President dies? Pelosi? LOL<br/>Maybe less amending the Constitution and more focus on grooming the right people to run for office.<br/><br/>Oh, and the original email that led me here stated that "bringing BushCo to justice" was "number one question to Obama online" when in fact that was Marijuana legalization.<br/>Better get that part right. Helping people who are sick, dying and languishing in prison takes clear priority over revenge against BushCo. As sweet as it might be.<br/><br/><br/>Keep up the good work.<br/>;)<br/><br/>

VOGEL | 5/26/09 3:55 AM EDT <br/><br/>A handful of high-ranking Obama administration officials this month delivered private briefings at the annual invitation-only conference held by an elite international organization known as the Bilderberg group.<br/> <br/>The closed meeting of some of the most powerful business, media and political leaders in North America and Western Europe heard from top Obama diplomats James Steinberg and Richard Holbrooke, who detailed the administration’s foreign policy, while economic adviser Paul Volcker, chairman of President Obama’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board, also gave a presentation at the heavily guarded seaside resort in Greece that hosted the event. <br/><br/><br/>The Bilderberg group, which takes its name from the Dutch hotel where it held its first meeting in 1954, exists solely to bring together between 100 and 150 titans of politics, finance, military, industry, academia and media from North America and Western Europe once a year to discuss world affairs. <br/>Its ultra-exclusive roster of globally influential figures has captured the interest of an international network of conspiracists, who for decades have viewed the Bilderberg conference as a devious corporate-globalist scheme. <br/><br/>This year’s closed-press meeting, held at the five-star Astir Palace hotel in Vouliagmeni on the Aegean Sea about 25 miles south of Athens, marked the 57th gathering of the opaque organization. <br/><br/>The publicity-shy Bilderberg group – which in a rare mass-circulation press release last year described itself as “a small, flexible, informal and off-the-record international forum in which different viewpoints can be expressed and mutual understanding enhanced” – has no website and participants are asked not to publicly discuss the proceedings. <br/>But a meeting attendee tells POLITICO that Holbrooke, a State Department special envoy, briefed attendees on the Obama administration’s unified approach to dealing with Afghanistan and Pakistan. <br/><br/>Steinberg, the deputy secretary of state, gave a presentation on the administration’s broader foreign policy and National Security Agency Director Lt. Gen. Keith Alexander also participated in the conference. <br/><br/>An assistant to Volcker said she did not know the subject of his presentation at this year’s meeting. A White House official stressed that Volcker is not a full-time employee and wasn’t representing Obama in Greece. The White House, State Department and NSA did not respond to questions about whether Alexander, Holbrooke and Steinberg – all repeat Bilderberger attendees – were representing the Obama administration at the meeting and whether tax dollars paid for their travel. <br/><br/>Steinberg, it should be noted, was in the region on official business for talks with officials from Greece, Macedonia and Montenegro, on the eve of Vice President Joe Biden’s trip to other Balkan states: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Serbia.<br/>Though Bilderberg tends to attract mostly former U.S. government officials, it’s not uncommon for sitting officials to attend. <br/><br/>Bilderberg stalwart Henry Kissinger, who’s attended more than half of its meetings, reportedly went at least twice during his stint as Secretary of State, while Alexander attended last year’s session as NSA director. In 2004, then-Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) attended the Bilderberg conference in Stresa, Italy, and both TIME magazine and the New York Times reported that his performance at a debate there played a role in his selection one month later as the vice presidential running mate for Democratic presidential nominee Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.<br/><br/>But any suggestion that Bilderberg is secretly anointing world leaders or plotting global policy is the provenance of “the black helicopter crowd,” the attendee of this year’s conference told POLITICO. <br/><br/>The meetings are “one of the least well-kept secrets in the world” and “don’t have any decision-making authority,” said the attendee, who did not want to be identified breaching Bilderberg’s off-the-record rule. The attendee called Bilderberg “a useful group of people who are well-connected and thoughtful who put on these meetings and usually invite a few people from the [U.S.] administration to come so they understand what the administration is doing<br/><br/>Obama’s Deputy National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, who attended the 2007 and 2008 Bilderberg meetings and until recently sat on the steering committee that picked invitees, did not respond to a request for comment about how invitees are selected.<br/>Other American participants at this year’s conference included World Bank President Robert Zoellick, billionaire Bilderberg regular David Rockefeller, academic Barnett Rubin and leading neoconservatives Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz, according to the attendee, who added that Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis also attended. <br/><br/>British press confirmed that top U.K. official Peter Mandelson was there. <br/><br/>Representatives of Obama economic advisor Larry Summers and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner – both of whom have participated in past Bilderberg meetings – refuted foreign press reports predicting their presence last weekend. <br/><br/>Geithner was in New York, said Treasury spokeswoman Heather Wong. “I don’t know how that [Bilderberg rumor] got out there. I had some foreign press calls asking me where he was last weekend, but I didn’t have any domestic calls.” <br/><br/>Indeed, the gathering produced barely a blip in the American mainstream media, with the only notable dispatches coming from a Wall Street Journal reporter who was barred entry to the usually publicly accessible Astir Palace hotel, and an Associated Press reporter who noted that it was being protected by “hundreds of police, navy commandos, coast guard speedboats and two F-16 fighter planes.” <br/><br/>As in past years, the near-absence of mainstream media coverage left Bilderberg-veil-piercing duties to a group of self-styled Bilderberg hunters whose reporting and speculation fill fringe, libertarian-leaning websites, newspapers and AM radio shows popular with those whose worldview is characterized by a deep and angry suspicion of the ruling class rather than any prevailing partisan or ideological affiliation. <br/><br/>“Leaked Agenda: Bilderberg Group Plans Economic Depression,” blared a headline early this month on the popular website Infowars, which is run by syndicated radio talk show host Alex Jones. <br/><br/>The story was based on reporting by veteran Bilderberg sleuth Daniel Estulin, whose sources told him Bilderbergers were torn between whether to initiate “a prolonged, agonizing depression that dooms the world to decades of stagnation, decline and poverty … or an intense-but-shorter depression that paves the way for a new sustainable economic world order, with less sovereignty but more efficiency.” <br/><br/>Estulin, the author of “The True Story of the Bilderberg Group,” claims to have infiltrated Bilderberg, and he told POLITICO that “in the end, the shorter-intense crowd within the Bilderbergers won out and so we’re going to be looking at a year, a year-and-a-half of really intense financial meltdown.” <br/><br/>Estulin, who was the first to report the precise location of Bilderberg 2009 (though in late 2007 he also reported that U.S. intelligence was considering assassinating Texas GOP Congressman and libertarian icon Ron Paul), declined to email POLITICO a copy of the pre-meeting booklet on which his story was based. <br/><br/>Both Estulin and Jim Tucker, another veteran Bilderberg hunter, insisted that Geithner—who Infowars reported was “to take orders from global elite at Bilderberg”—attended this year’s conference. <br/><br/>Tucker, who edits the nationalist American Free Press newspaper, traveled to Greece to report on last weekend’s Bilderberg meeting. He says he’s been on the sidelines of about 30 of the meetings. At this year’s event, two of his reporters were confronted by the Greek Navy when they rented a boat to try to take photographs of beachside Bilderbergers from the sea, he said. <br/><br/>“They don’t want the world to know how they’re planning our lives,” <br/>Tucker contended. <br/>“Obama is Bilderberg’s obedient little boy. He’ll follow orders.”<br/><br/>

      Actually, I forgot to mention that I have issues with the vice-president suggestion.  If there is a problem that requires immediate action in case of an inability of the president to serve, I have no issues with the vice-president taking over.  One can then seek his/her impeachment if the situation warrants it.<br/><br/>I do agree with most of Captain Kona's comments... we did not, alas, elect Kucinich, so the thing is to keep up the pressure on the man we did elect.

      If a vice president runs the country, the president cannot be impeached because everyone can scream "WHAT do you want a president Cheney???" knowing that he's already guilty of the same crimes.  So you have to impeach the Veep and then the Prez, and that's too much for poor wittle congress members to contemplate.  But if the Veep sticks to his or her constitutional role of serving as president of the Senate and existing in case the president can no longer serve, then the president is indeed "unitary" and can be held accountable and can be replaced by a vice president not responsible for the impeachable offenses.

      Hi, This to folks who like the general idea with exception of abolishing the senate.  If you think about it, does it really make sense for two people from every state to have the same say in things, not to mention what compromises and campaign contributions have been made to get there?  I'm reminded of a story about a holiday where the youngest generation's girl asked her mom "why do you cut off both ends of the ham, Mama?"  "I don't know, that's what my mom always did." So they ask G'ma who replies "Just did it the way my Mama taught me." and they find Great Grandma and ask her why the ends were cut off the ham and she said "The largest pan I had couldn't fit a whole ham, so I cut the ends off."  So, just because you're used to having a senate which has really not proved to be at all useful if you are<br/>one of "the people", look at what progress they have handily managed to keep Congress from doing. If your senator is one you like, you can help them be a member of the house of representatives, the body that is elected to represent you, because there are quite a few congress folks that need replacing.<br/>I hope everyone takes a few minutes to send this to everyone they know.<br/>Peace if we want it bad enough and make some time to create it.<br/>Thank you, David, for putting this out here.

A statement of a part of our grievances is, therefore, submitted to an impartial world, in justification of the hazards but unavoidable step now taken of severing our political support and connection with the present Congress, Senate and Executive Branch of our Federal government and assuming an attitude of remorse for our CONGRESS allowed and empowered actions amiss among those mentioned nations of the earth. <br/><br/>II.<br/>Our present past and present Executive leadership [hereafter called it], by its illicit pre-planed war intentions, convinced WE THE PEOPLE and CONGRESS by deception and the horrors inflicted on our soil after 911 that war was imminent.  Then induced the American population to pledge their faith to war efforts to restrain, restrict and rid our nation from more acts of terrorism. Thus in so doing WE THE PEOPLE should continue to enjoy our constitution liberty and democratic government to which we had been habituated in the land of our birth, the United States of America.  In this expectation they have cruelly disappointed, and have acquiesced in their changes made in the government by it who having altered substantively the constitution of this county, and now offers us the cruel alternation either to abandon our people property and liberties, or submit to the most intolerable of all tyranny, the combined despotism of Federal Law Enforcement and Armies and the vile contemptible past and present Executive Branch of our government.  <br/><br/>III.<br/>It has sacrificed our people property and welfare toward war efforts in the countries of Iraq and Afghanistan by which our interests have been continually depressed through a jealous and partial course of legislation, and carried on at a far removed from saneness and alien to consent seat of our government, by a hostile Executive majority, and this, too notwithstanding we have petitioned in the humblest terms for CONGRESS to enforce the LAWS of impeachment in accordance with the provisions of the United State Constitution. And WE THE PEOPLE have presented in the media and Internet and to CONGRESS our pleas and without just cause, ALL have been contemptuously rejected. <br/><br/>IV.<br/>It has failed and refused to secure absolute justice and has implemented such into the PATRIOT ACT, on a firm basis, the right of trial by jury, that palladium of civil liberty, and only safe guarantee for the life, liberty, and property of all peoples.<br/><br/>V.<br/>It has failed to empower more and bring sober judgments and sound resolutions too our public system of education, although possessed of almost boundless resource [public domain] and, although it is an axiom, in political science, that unless a people are educated and enlightened, It is idle to expect the continuance of civil liberty or the capacity for self-government. <br/><br/><br/>VI.<br/>It has suffered the Federal Investigative and Enforcers of law officials, and their employees and emissaries stationed among us and abroad, to exercise arbitrary acts of secrecy ambiguity oppression and tyranny; thus trampling upon the most sacred rights of the citizen and rendering the military superior to civil power. <br/><br/>VII.<br/>It has dissolved, by force of arms, the nations of Iraq and Afghanistan and obliged the indigenous contiguous people to flee for their lives and from their people and property and seats of governments; thus depriving them of their fundamental rights of life and political right of representation. <br/>VIII.<br/>It has demanded the surrender of a number of their citizens, and ordered military detachments to seize and carry them into prisons for trial; in contempt of the civil authorities, and in defiance of the laws of those nations. <br/><br/>IX.<br/>It has made piratical attacks upon our treasuries, by commissioning national and foreign desperadoes and mercenaries and Federal Law Enforcement authorizing them to lay claim to territories alien to our core needs. And to expend our national treasuries on the unprovoked wars and enormous buildup of long-term military installations in both Iraq and Afghanistan. And to seize property of Iraq and Afghanistan citizens in confiscation for the intended use of the energy barons. <br/><br/>X.<br/>It denies us the right of worshiping the Almighty according to the dictates of our own religious zeal conscience and independent commitment to the our GOD, by the illicit use of our personal and combined treasuries and the unconscionable treatment of our military men and women many dying in vain for the needless and endless wars, all calculated to promote the temporal financial interest of its servile alliances to the tyrannical barons of industry, energy and communications rather than the glory of the true and living Creator.<br/><br/>XI.<br/>It has constrained us to take away our voice of dissent, which is essential to our defense, the rightful voice of freemen, and precursor to a formidable foe only to tyrannical governments. <br/><br/>XII.<br/>It has invaded our homes and homeland with intent to lay waste our territory and elicit safety and security from our homes; and now has a large mercenary of armies at its disposal soon to be advancing to carry on against us and others wars on terror in selective extermination. <br/><br/>XIII.<br/>It has, through its secret emissaries, incited the merciless savage, with, sophisticated weapons of war to massacre inhabitants in our offensive invading wars against hapless defenseless nations. <br/><br/>XIV.<br/>It has been, during the entire time of our allegiance with it, made contemptible sport and victim of us with it successive laid claims as intolerable revolutionaries towards our constitution, and us and has continually exhibited every characteristic of a weak, corrupt, and tyrannical government led by the wishes of those who have a will to destroy. <br/><br/>XV.<br/>These, and other grievances, were patiently borne by WE THE PEOPLE until they reached that point at which forbearance ceases to be a virtue. We then took up our combined voice again in defense of the national constitution. We appealed to our brethren for assistance.  Our appeals thus far have been made in vain.  Through months and even years have elapsed. No sympathetic response has yet been heard from CONGRESS.  We are, therefore, forced to the melancholy conclusion that the past and present Executive Branch has acquiesced in the destruction of our liberty, and the substitution therefore of a military government--that they insist we are unfit to be free and incapable of self-government. <br/><br/>XVI.<br/>The necessity of our mortal and immortal self-preservation, therefore, now decrees our eternal Declaration and Petition Congress without redress that we enjoin at this date as the vested highest ranking controlling communed members of We the People to indict and/or impeach try convict fine and banish with out impunity enablers makers and profiteers of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the inclusive war on terror and the enablers and makers of our present financial crisis. <br/><br/>XVII.<br/>	It has suffered a disproportion of illicit terror on the estimated 750,000 morally sound and believer in the Creator of all fellow believers in Iraq many tens of thousands have left their homes, land people and property fleeing from Iraq during our war efforts for fear of their lives. Thus ridding the commands of our Creator as null and void. <br/><br/>WE THE PEOPLE, therefore, as the constitutional empowered delegates, with plenary powers, of the people of the United States of America, in solemn sober and resolute connectivity have assembled, appealing to a candid world for the necessities of our conditions, do hereby resolve and declare that our eternal Declaration and Petition Congress without redress that we enjoin at this date as the vested highest ranking controlling communed members of We the People.  Thus proving that we have severed our political connection with the present Executive Branch of our nation to wit has ended; and that WE THE PEOPLE do now constitute a free, sovereign, and independent highest ranking voice, and are fully invested with all the rights and attributes which properly belong to independent people; and conscious of the rectitude of our intentions, we have fearlessly and confidently committed these issues to the decision of the Supreme Arbiter of the destiny of each as individuals and of WE THE PEOPLE .<br/><br/><br/>	Thus I_______________________________do solemnly swear by a formal oath and by the testament of my name that I am a conjoined contiguous solicitous one of WE THE PEOPLE.

      Hello All<br/><br/>Your goals are admirable. But sending something like that writing above by Robert David Steele to the government, even though I basically agree with a lot of it, goes wildly too far. You have to start where we are, I think. If you maybe would stick to two of your points - lobbying for prosecuting Cheney and Bush and amending the War Powers Act to put time limits on wars, then in a letter to the government you might get some real attention. (Probably not, of course.) This stuff goes so ridiculously far you could be easily dismissed as nuts raving. I think you should try to be intellengent and reasonable people in public, not wild immature revolutionaries (in dreamworld) with demeands, because there is a lot of potential support for you, a lot of people don't trust the government any more. I too think Obama's with the Bilderbergers...<br/> <br/>blessings forever<br/><br/>Andy Pratt, musician<br/><br/><br/>http://www.myspace.com/andyprattrocks <br/><br/>http://www.myspace.com/andyprattlovesyou <br/><br/>http://www.myspace.com/andyprattagain <br/><br/>http://www.myspace.com/andyprattwillneverdie <br/><br/>http://www.myspace.com/andyprattthebook <br/><br/>http://www.myspace.com/andyprattresolution <br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZhJpUC1nzI love insurance <br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOtMKhJZEo4 avenging annie<br/><br/>http://superbikemoto.com/vbulletin/vBTube.php?do=view&vidid=UhX9ko2MoQs fun in the first world<br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4ciyJe9Dq4 who will be my friend 1<br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYiaHw3XxL8&eurl<br/> who will be my friend 2<br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybBCJPxm_bE&feature=related treasure that canary<br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-_ydwtBj5Q&feature=related Karen's Song<br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su1V9dJeeoA Keep your mind on Me<br/><br/>http://www.itsaboutmusic.com/andypratt.html  this is my main site for sales<br/><br/>https://www2.xlibris.com/bookstore/bookdisplay.asp?bookid=36742 this is the site to buy my book.

      I agree with it all. And to anybody that says it's too much to ask for or demand: you can never demand too much justice.<br/><br/>The part about the V.P. doesn't mean the V.P. couldn't take over for the Prez in event of emergency. It's talking about the V.P. exercising presidential powers while the President is still in power like Cheney did under Bush.<br/><br/>I would also add Stop The Drug War to this since that is really just a way to take our rights away.<br/><br/>Let's all keep dreaming... and working for justice!

We must wake up stand up speak out stop the madness right now or nothing is going to be left but a bunch of morons doing moronic stuff. While the bandits run off with our country lock stock and barrel. <br/><br/>So go on with your chitchat nonsense and turn off the lights when you are through --- or else maybe the light bill won’t get paid and they will go off by themselves. <br/><br/>Wake up men you sound like mice. <br/>

      TELL ME WHO WHAT WHEN HOW AND WHY?  SPENT OUR MONEY!<br/><br/>Now there we all go.  That is what our laws that get through Congress and the Senate are about.  Way too much for them and us to comprehend but sad to say that is just the way our bad and going worse Federal Government works.  Our big fat checkbook and they spend like crazy.  Why just because we let them.  That is right we could call a halt to their spending spree, if we really wanted.   But, do you want to stop their spending spree? <br/><br/>What I have to say about that today is just too much mum boo jumbo.  Seems no one that goes before Congress or the Senate can answer plain and simple questions, as in the title, about money.  And when push comes to shove the ones to answer just keep on dodging. Sounds a bit like trying to get answers out of a gone wild teenager. <br/><br/>A good friend of mine sent me a bill before a State to be voted on.  My nine-year-old grandson could have done better.  What the bill finally said ---we want to spend your money for something not real sure for what---- you might get some benefits ----but that is still to be determined ---- but give us an approval to write some checks and maybe someday it might or might not all work out. <br/><br/>So what are we to do, as a people?  Easy answer --- We must have those we trust to do our legal bidding and battle for us on Capitol Hill.  And that is that. <br/><br/>We must as a coalition take our power [3 to 5 million of us] to Congress and the Senate and say boys and girls we come to have the final and most powerful vote on all issues.  So move over give us a seat or get out. <br/><br/>Now how hard would that be?  We 3 to 5 million strong can do that make monthly pledges hire our own attorneys and experts to do what we want.  We must fight the battles with lawyers on our side the best in the west.  See folks that are what lobbyist are and what they do. They wage war against us now----so to get an even chance we must do the same thing. <br/><br/>So bottom line WE MUST TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK.  We own it not them---they are our servants just getting paid to do what we tell them too but they have forgotten to whom they serve. <br/><br/>THE VOICES FOR WE THE PEOPLE ADVOCATES ---WTPA for Grass Roots Actions needed for forming our own truth filled lobby in Washington DC to power push our VOICES and VOTES of the people for our rights to life in acts of equity with Justice. <br/>Dwight Baker Chairman PO BOX 7065 Eagle Pass, TX 78853 Tel/fax 1-830-773-1077 Contact E-mail dbaker007@stx.rr.com<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

      This sounds like a big proposal with too many points rolled into it. But I think it works. It's getting a good response and the points are relative to each other. It's not like it would be considered as all or nothing anyway. But with a lot of votes it might make a splash. I think a lot of people agree with most of these points.

      Josh Senecal There is no other way but this one---We must rule ourselves---Now how----only 1 to 3.8% of the people care enough to get involved but they the larger percent are good to the core Americans. The 3 to 5 million of us would be from the grass roots up first in TownHall type internet meetings--then that info would go to the districts---then up to the 50 regions then complied to go on into DC. In DC we will have three boards of directors that will govern what is done for the people needs wants and wishes. Grass roots board of directors will have the most power, the other two ---Founders---and Star powers in acitons will have a say also. Once decesions are made our cadre of good Lawyers will go to work to make all happen. The RULE OF LAW is our only salvation. <br/><br/>FAMOUS QUOTES BY FREDRICK DOUGLAS 1818 ----- 1885<br/><br/>America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future.<br/><br/>At a time like this, a scorching iron, not convincing argument, is needed.<br/><br/>Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have the exact measure of the injustice and wrong, which will be imposed on them.<br/><br/>I prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others, rather than to be false, and to incur my own abhorrence.<br/><br/>If there is no struggle, there is no progress.<br/><br/>It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.<br/><br/>It is not light that we need, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake.<br/><br/>No man can put a chain about the ankle of his fellow man without at last finding the other end fastened about his own neck.<br/><br/>Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.<br/><br/>The life of a nation is secure only while the nation is honest, truthful, and virtuous.<br/><br/>The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppose.<br/><br/>The thing worse than rebellion is the thing that causes rebellion.<br/><br/>To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker.<br/><br/>Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe.<br/><br/><br/>WE THE PEOPLE IN UNITY<br/><br/>In 2008 We the People in Unity and the United States of America People in general came together for an historic moment in our nation’s history, when we formally through our voices and votes revolted peacefully against the leadership in the Republican and Democratic Party who had Stolen from Generations – those many young the Stolen Generation that were born during the eight years of the GW Bush administration that had their virtue stolen.   The many young and old people alike who were intricately and forcibly cheated lied too stolen from and some lost their lives for the many despot tyrannical actions imposed on them by the GW Bush Administration. And in the end many were [with intent by the GW Bush Administration] isolated from and some removed from their families, friends’ next of kin and their communities and have been made to suffer through the contemptible policies, sanctions and precepts in actions of past governments aligned with and as forerunners to the GW Bush administration. <br/><br/>We have said sorry to the many afflicted during our lifetime for the laws and policies of successive city, state and federal government that inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on our fellow Americans, in particular the Stolen Generation – those who are suffering from the hurt, the humiliation, the cruelty and the sheer brutality of being taken mentally and oft times physically from their born cores in life their mothers and their fathers, their families and their people and their innate born hope for a life with rights.<br/><br/>This reckoning of this dark chapter of our nation’s history has also been about recognizing past wrongdoings and in a modest legal but forthright way standing up and shouting out as a people in unity demanding for righting the wrongs of the past. The reckoning has been our first step. <br/><br/>Therefore our goal of the people at large has been to move forward together as a unified nation, and build a stronger and fairer America in the twenty-first century, we are now being called on again to take a stand once more and call on the Barack Obama administration to address the appalling gap between the life opportunities enjoyed by the 99% of our population the working class and the mega wealthy barons in receipt of the spoils of war comprising 1% of our population native to or immigrants from other nations but all living in the boundaries with safety in our United States of America.  <br/><br/>Throughout the history of our great nations growth children born to the working class has had far less and limited opportunities than a Opulent Rich Aristocratic east coast blue blood families.  We the people in Unity are resolutely determined to change this reality. <br/><br/>Closing the Gap is fundamentally important to building a fairer America.  In the later decades of the twentieth century, our nation implemented some important legal reforms that recognized the equality and equity of all born in our Abundant and Great American Nation becoming the law. While legal rights are essential for overcoming entrenched disadvantage, rights alone cannot close the gap. They only establish a foundation for making progress.<br/><br/>The challenge we now confront is to work together to close the gap in real life outcomes between working class and the Overtly Privileged Aristocrats, Americans.  This is the objective to which We the people in Unity are committed, but we cannot achieve on its own. As a nation founded on the rule of LAW we must come together around this vision and take substantive action – for the rights of the working class and the privileged Aristocratic to be ferreted out in rights to life for all in acts of equity in justice. Then those processes must continue throughout in each state, city and county governments, business small and large and in the wider greater community. And in the end strict accounting of the progress must become a mater of law with enforcement.<br/><br/>This is an historic achievement for We the People in Unity to have such an agreement. It is the first time that a truly national commitment – encompassing all governments – has been made that aims to ensure that all born in the United States of America have an equitable share in the opportunities, which our nation offers.<br/><br/>At the same time We the People in Unity must be realistic and acknowledge the size of the task ahead of us. Meeting our targets will not be easy, and at times may be controversial, but we must not be deflected from our goals. <br/><br/>This statement outlines We the People in Unity approach to closing the Gap. It describes progress in our first phase, and sets out our priorities for the future. There is much to be done, and it will require patience, perseverance and a sustained national effort from every part of the American community. In the years ahead, we aim to report annually on the progress America is making towards this national objective to all and to our vast and worldwide community of Nations. <br/> <br/>We the People in Unity <br/>Declare <br/><br/><br/>When a government has ceased to protect the lives, liberty and property of WE THE PEOPLE, from whom its legitimate powers are derived, and for the advancement of whose happiness it was instituted falters and fails in substantive issues, matters and things we must re-institute in a legal form for our voices and votes to be heard. <br/><br/>And so far the present form of our Federal Government has not been a guarantee for the enjoyment of those inestimable and inalienable rights, but has become an instrument in the hands of evil rulers for their oppression: <br/><br/>When the Constitution of our country, which they have sworn to support, no longer has a substantial existence, and the whole nature of our government has been forcibly changed, without WE THE PEOPLE consent, from a democratic republic, composed of sovereign states change must come and quickly.<br/><br/> Our Federal Government has in many ways become a consolidated central military despotism, in which every interest if pursued could degenerate the Rights of the Life of its citizens by the Federal Investigative and Enforcement Law. <br/><br/>And in the recent past our Executive Branch of the Federal Government and all that become appointed and employees to duties both have proved to be the eternal enemies of our civil liberties and have made visible the ever-ready minions of power, the usual instrument of tyrants and to that end we as a People must demand indictments be brought to bear on the offenders in perfecting the laws of our Constitution. <br/>  <br/>When, long after the spirit of the Constitution has departed, those in power at length, so far lose moderation that even the semblance of freedom has been removed and to that end we as a People must take up a legal stand to demand change. <br/><br/>And when all the forms of the Constitution has been discounted and discontinued to a meaningless set of laws and edicts for which all citizens should abide by and live we, as People must demand a legal oversight for change. <br/><br/>And so far many petitions and remonstrance's have been regarded, the agents who bear them are thrown into all sorts of terror filled restraints inclusive prisons of despair, and mercenary agents and armies have been dispatched to force sovereign citizens in America and some in other Nations at the point of the tools of war: <br/><br/>And when, the present matters of great concern if not stopped now the consequence of such acts of malfeasance and abdication on the part of our federal government, anarchy will prevail, and our civil society will be dissolved into its original elements.<br/><br/>In such a crisis, the first law of nature, the right of self-preservation, the inherent and inalienable right of WE THE PEOPLE to appeal to first principles and take their political affairs into our own hands in extreme case, enjoins it as a right towards us. <br/><br/>And it is a sacred obligation to our posterity and us to make legal certainty that the many offenders in the military and federal government as elected executives, employees, appointees, and envoys are indicted or impeached, tried, convicted, fined, banished with no impunity.<br/><br/>And in such causes to be Constitutionally elicited ---- worthy others are to be empowered as substitutes in lieu of the next term of elected officials to resume elected powers, calculated to rescue WE THE PEOPLE from impending dangers, and to secure our future welfare and happiness in all legal actions needed to preserve our solvency and sovereignty. <br/><br/>Therefore the problems in our Congress today -- is such that our country has far too many in population today to be served by such a limited few. <br/><br/>Accordingly We The People has put our best effort forward to elect a President to take the lead and do what is right for us.  And that effort appears to have become a languishing effort or a far cry from getting what is needed done today about the failed fraught with fraud past and if not changed now will set a lackluster legal precedent for our future as well. <br/><br/>Lobbyist represents the very ones that have caused the erratic decline of our nation.  They write many of the laws that go on to be voted, by our Congress and Senators that have never read the contents.  Thus We The People must enter that same arena and write the laws that protects and serves our interests, forming our own LOBBY in Washington DC to protect all our rights to life. <br/><br/>The BUSH Administration in all of its known derision, decadents with actions by dissenters, in our rich and abundant America and world wide too has caused multiple disasters and that has aroused an awareness of those with Patriotic views to stand firm, shoot out with strident voices and not to back down or cower but to press on toward moving our Democratic Republic to a restored legal right and height for representation of the people to be fully restored.  <br/><br/>Some Barons of banking, trade and commerce, the makers of the tools of war and many others that need to stay under our protection of us as a Nation --- has caused multiplicities of infractions against us while they took care business their own way.  And many times that has involved killing innocence people out and about in the world’s populations. Black Water works for Chevron in the Congo and it has been reported that Bush created AFRICOM to do likewise under the guise of propping up failing Democracies.  It is reported that We the People pay for and to that end support over seven hundred active military installations throughout the earth today and up till now we have had no recourse or redress against those kind of military actions. <br/>

      LUVWITH <br/><br/>Forget about public financing of campaigns ---the media is on the take too. We are under siege by the Bilderbergs---so we all must get a life and forget what we thought was real and deal with the present fires burning behind the scenes. <br/><br/>YES you are right corruption everywhere we look but what can we do about it?  Just gripe and complain. NO we need our own folks on the ground in DC to take names get videos publish that on CSPAN for free have the real NEWS not VIEWS. Then all along make the Justice Department prosecute. We are many they are FEW hope you see now the bigger and brighter picture. First off when in DC we need to set up seven new Federal District courts bring in from other nations good judges to preside. Then whom are the Bilderbergs going to buy of then. After there we will get the Pentagon to assign us security forces to aid us in all ways. Along with the CIA FBI get our backside covered. <br/><br/>NOW the most recent con---that is being pushed along is GM.  We the people are going to own 70% is that good?  Not in my opinion. Why?  Question, what is the cost to erase their nasty footprints all over America for the environmental hazards that they created?  Good question.  CONS just continue to go on, and nobody with a brain or half of one cares that is those that gets a green check each month one of HIRED HANDS, or gets his or hers wallet padded as is often done by the lobbyist. <br/>

      dbaker007,<br/><br/> I don’t disagree with all you say, but I also don't read all you are posting. To state "now, now" makes me feel it’s a push of ideology.  We may have some of the same ideas or even all but you won’t reach me with this approach. You may not mean it this way but it has come across.<br/><br/>Fredrick Douglas was a great man; he didn’t receive his freedom overnight and with a blinding –now, now-.  But that approach made him state that Lincoln was "the white man's president" I’m sure his haste moment today would not slip by with the media and could have dampened his other works.<br/><br/>Lets about talk today and not quote hundreds of quotes… just put one you live by.<br/><br/>Oh, the –now,now- is how Bush operated and I don’t support that.<br/><br/>

      Josh, <br/><br/>I live by all of the ones I posted by Douglas.  His words mean more to me and us than some of the others.  He was a slave that had to run away from here for years before he could get enough money to pay for his freedom.  Is that not what we must do likewise.  Pay to get our freedom back.  The Now is as I said. <br/><br/>The Beast that is against us---uses law---The Obama Administration is full of them that are from the source the Bilderbergs or the Beast. <br/><br/>What we must not let happen again is another Hank Paulson walking in and demanding things get done overnight.  Look at the trouble we are in today with the thought to be $55 trillion dollar PONZI scheme.  <br/><br/>Now my take is this----We the people went for years maybe from 6 to 8 putting up with the BUSH BUNCH.  A few of us began getting more involved in Politics etc. but we are the few.  The greater sector just rolled over and continued to watch the VIEWS and said OK if that is what they want to do. <br/><br/>Saying the mafia type Bilderbergs thought this is the right time.  The timing is right for us to take America for our military mite to take the rest of the world for us.  Now is does not stop there.  Their plans are sadistic and can only become a reality when one digs deeper into their mindsets. <br/><br/>I am a guest here, and I will not intrude to be rude or unkind to anyone. But to get to the core of their Bilderbergs in-humanity just google some of these words and follow them out then you along with other will be aghast as I was also. <br/><br/>Religion of re-animalized man----japanized man <br/><br/>http://911review.com/denial/gatekeepers.html<br/><br/>http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Secret-meeting-of-worlds-richest-people-held-in-New-York-45304702.html<br/><br/>http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=13544<br/><br/><br/>

Bush's actions created and continue to create more terrorists.  Bush made us less safe with his and Cheney's elevated view of themselves over the laws of this country.  We are a nation of laws. We are not a nation of Bush/Cheney's opinions.<br/><br/>We must stop procrastinating and prosecute now. With other countries attempting to prosecute, it is embarrassing that we have not stood true to our values.  Obama will have allowed Bush and Cheney's views to become American if he fails to prosecute.   <br/><br/>America amnd Obama will have no integrity and will not be able to restore its values if we fail to prosecute those who are responsible for these atrocities. <br/><br/>The world is watching and waiting and getting impatient.

      I'd have to have more information to weigh in on several of the constitutional amendments suggested here, but the basic premise is what I support – everyone must obey the law (including current and former executive branch officials) and those who don’t must be held accountable for their crimes, including executive branch officials.<br/><br/>I completely agree with the list of laws David would like to repeal, but a lot of what I consider necessary involves following existing law and initiating an honest discussion of existing and necessary limits to executive power in a democracy.  Open government is of very little value if the dialogue in which we openly engage is dishonest.<br/><br/>For example, we need and end to the following:<br/><br/>1)	The bizarre and dangerous claim that laws are irrelevant if the president or other officials decide they have a really good reason for breaking them (e.g. the existence of terrorists).  Nothing justifies the crimes of aggressive war, including foreign invasions and occupations and remote bombing; attacking sites where civilian casualties are inevitable; assassinations, torture, rendition and indefinite detention; domestic spying, eliminating habeas corpus, refusing to release information that should be public, refusing to prosecute crimes by high level government officials ...).  These are tactics of repressive, rogue regimes – immoral and counterproductive, as well as illegal. <br/>2)	The claim that the president, or anyone else who's taken the oath of office, can choose whether or not to investigate or prosecute crimes of former officials.  There is no legal basis for this.  The president and his officials swore to uphold and defend the constitution.  No exceptions.  Covering up crimes is just as illegal as committing the original crime.  Calling it a pragmatic choice is dishonest.<br/>3)	Our two tiered system of justice, with harsh penalties for ordinary citizens and immunity from the law for government and corporate elites.  The only ways to maintain this injustice are via continued secrecy and illegitimate claims of immunity from the law for certain classes of people. <br/><br/>This is all completely counter to democracy and open government.<br/><br/>

      A LOT TO BE SAID ABOUT SPECIFICS<br/><br/>But what about the raw facts clearly seen that are criminal knowing those things …. as we do we must focus to take action today to lock up the bad guys first ? <br/><br/>We must look first at just the numbers.  We the good sound and sane are many and the bad guys are few. <br/><br/>We have what it takes right now to take back our rights to call the shots in our rich and abundant America.  And talking about mincing out each little bit of the things to do is pale in comparison to taking it back first. <br/><br/>When a robbery of a bank is in progress--- forget about fact-finding—just put the robber in handcuffs worry about all the other stuff next.  That in my books is called raw focus.  We must today go to the heart of the problem and get rid of the cancer that is eating our American core away.  Now do you agree?  Sure hope so, we need all to work hand in hand to take back our great land.  To rid out the old line of thieves and do what is right and shun all the wrongs and before we would know it all of America would be in fine shape again as it was intended to be.  <br/><br/>The Bilderbergs have plans to make all humankind slaves to their edicts and laws. Slavery in any way form or fashion is to be punished. Those who compose schemes to do so should stand trial before good international judges hired by us in seven new federal courts instituted by us in and around DC and New York and be sentenced to the maximum penalties. <br/><br/>The Bilderbergs have been empowering human stupidity that has been the plan for a long time to make a way to deceive all. For many to just roll over, moan and groan but do nothing about the crimes against our fellow Americans and this earth citizens.  Those that might be on the lookout for the Bilderbergs future--- as you read this --- if the shoe fits just wear it. We will see you in court as you try to defend yourself soon.  <br/><br/>If any of us should be so carefree to deny the truth that is plan and obvious just look in your rear view mirror for they are in hot pursuit to get all we have and put us in a ball and chain to work for free with just a morsel of bread a day and maybe a cup of clean water to drink.  Then for us that have grandkids that come along they will be swept away like Hitler did to be schooled in the acts of terror against whom you might ask?   Just look in the mirror. <br/><br/>Our enemies are within…the thieves are trying to rob us blind…the old guard called the crowd or the Bilderbers are leading the way…they are not civil sound or even in my estimation human.  They all tell lies…the pack of them could not put together a good puzzle…they are want to be elites drinking from the same well that Hitler, Stalin, and all the Bush Bunch did.  And if there is a road destined for hell that bunch is in high gear to get there. <br/><br/>Now the good news is … the Bilderbergs seemed victory is NOT on the way, for the good of us have decided to stand up shout out enough of the madness and right behind us is the Sheriff and his posse that has handcuffs in hands and is going to lock up David Rockefeller [he is known by the Bilderbergs to be KING OF THE WORLD] and Henry Kissinger [his words proves he is the worst war criminal of all time] … then start down from the top of the list next [the many in the Presidents Administration] till it bottoms out. We believe about 5 to 7 thousand that are the lawless bunch and their words and deeds right now prove it without a doubt. <br/><br/>We are taking the lead by waking up standing up and shouting out stop the madness. <br/><br/>To do the right and just thing JOIN IN with us.  <br/> <br/>The PLAN --- We The People Advocates WTPA are providing the only HOPE in saving our great nation.  So JOIN IN and ENLIST to serve with your VOICES being heard and your VOTES being counted and moved along to our lobby group in Washington DC to power push the peoples needs, wants and wishes in our cities, states and Federal Governments for all Americans to have the rights to life in all ways in equity adjudicated by the Bar of Justice.

      The Imperial Presidency allows our nation's elected President (when not selected by the Supreme Court) to become a Rogue Emperor in the worst traditions of the Roman Empire.  No accountability, no liability, no transparency as evidenced most recently by the Bush regime.  The founding fathers foreshadowed that these sorts of powers would be the greatest threat to the newly formed representative government.  It is up to Congress to reign these rogues in, but clearly, Congress is not up to the task.  One institution after the other (NSA, CIA, Justice, State Dept., DOD)is manipulated and corrupted when the the Executive Branch is allowed Imperial power.

      I for just one would NEVER want to abolish anything that our Constitution put in place, and that means the Senate. <br/><br/>So I suppose I don’t get the drift at this time. I stand by my words and that is that, if other words are to be mixed and mingled into some form other. Then like jfsabl said I would need to see the final compilation before I agreed.  Just like our congressman and Senators that said OK to the Patriot Act and never read it --- SAD DAY FOR ALL OF US FOR SURE. No reason to go back to that kind of idiocy. <br/><br/>I would hope David and all here would never engage in that kind of stupidity for any reason in any season.  If this group is supposed to be the more enlighten as I suspect it to be, let us not let down the many others that are counting on us to lead. <br/><br/>First impressions mean everything to many and me too. <br/>

      Never change the Constitution? And undo a couple of dozen amendments immediately?  Go back to white guys get to vote and slaves count less in a census? <br/><br/>If you say so.  <br/><br/>The Senate, by the way, blocked 8 attempts by the House to end slavery.  The Senate has always blocked better proposals from the House.  That was its intended purpose.<br/><br/>It does provide disproportionate representation for smaller states, but it also strips state governments of power in ways the House alone probably would not.  And while Senators favor campaign corruption, wall street giveaways, illegal spying, torture, war, union busting, slashing school funding, polluting the environment, and propping up private health insurance far more than do members of the House, the same cannot be said of residents of small states as compared to large.<br/><br/>End it, don't mend it.

      May 28, 2009<br/><br/>David <br/><br/>My take has been and shall remain but until we get control we cannot do.  We need a Constitutional Convention to set new size’s for the Congress and Senate. <br/><br/>My Take we need five times more Congress people.  We need the larger states to have more <br/>Senators as per five times New York needs 10 instead of 2 the same is true in each of the larger States. Then that number of multiples dwindles down as the population of the state does. <br/><br/>We also need to break the two party system thus in local Congress and Senate elections all kinds of folks could gain local support and win----Doctors, PhD, business people, house wives, clergy, Mechanics, welders etc.  Thus the will of the people would be heard.  <br/><br/>Once done there would be far more folks tending to taking care of our business on Capitol Hill. <br/><br/>Then instead of have empowered the ones we have now to set on 16 different panels and such we could spread the workload around. Thus instead of having the senseless drama unfold as seen on CSPAN questions are asked by some of the worse morons I have ever seen and heard.  IE: would you have Barney Frank over for lunch? Neither would I.  Then do what my Great Uncle from Switzerland once said, “If you want a job done right do it yourself”, thus each could go and inspect the work that “was expected to be done” but check first hand. <br/><br/>Now that is a VIEW that all here will agree. No doubt about it. But we cannot do those things until we take back control.  All we can do now is plan and that is in the making as I write this. Good things are in store for us in America and it is all right around the corner. I have a page on CARE2  http://www.care2.com/c2c/people/profile.html?pid=664781840                                                                                         <br/>and there I have a worldview of what people want done in America first hand.  They are all cheering us on to do the right thing now. We are still the beacons of hope for civilized man but we must seize this opportunity now. As one of my hero’s Fredrick Douglas once said <br/><br/>If there is no struggle, there is no progress.<br/><br/>It is not light that we need, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake.<br/><br/>Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.<br/><br/>The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppose.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

      Ending the Imperial Presidency would be nice. I gave it a thumbs-up. But It'll never happen without freedom of the press. Everything hinges on the First Amendment, which has been gutted for all practical purposes. That's why we need a simple, accessible system that will let ordinary people know WHO OWNS THE MEDIA, Idea #664, http://opengov.ideascale.com/akira/dtd/3276-4049<br/><br/>(If they can put a spell-checker into this system to help me spell "accessible," they can put in a system that shows who controls the major media.)<br/><br/>The Imperial Presidency wouldn't last a day if the masses knew about it.

      tttahiti and ALL <br/><br/>FREE PRESS FORGET ABOUT IT---- We have is the internet for a time so let us all use it--- to tell the RAW FACTS.  Now 3 to 5 million of us all on the same page can seize Capitol Hill legally and get things going our way we would have about 1000 good lawyers and aids to get things done for us.  We would have the majority vote in Congress and in the Senate and could veto anything that the Administration tried to cram down. Now do the math all kick in $25 bucks per month----Hello Lobby for sure with that kind of leverage. <br/><br/>IT WOULD BE NICE TO STEP BACK IN TIME …….. BUT? <br/><br/>A lot has been said today about specifics, but what about the RAW FACTS that is clearly seen and we all know about those at the top of the heap that are criminals. As we go forward to try and restore journalism the car industry or workforce our starving Americans and all the many others in need …. We better settle in get in one mind and one accord then focus to take action today to lock up the BAD GUYS FIRST.  <br/><br/>We must look first at just the numbers.  We the good sound and sane are many and the bad guys are few. <br/><br/>We have what it takes right now to take back our rights to call the shots in our rich and abundant America.  And talking about mincing out each little bit of the things to do is pale in comparison to taking our America back first. <br/><br/>When a robbery of a bank is in progress--- forget about fact-finding—just put the robber in handcuffs worry about all the other stuff next.  That in my books is called RAW FOCUS.   We must today go to the heart of the problem and get rid of the cancer that is eating at our American core.  Now do you agree?  Sure hope so, we need all to work hand in hand to take back our great land.  To rid out the old line of thieves and do what is right and shun all the wrongs and before we would know it all of America would be in fine shape again as it was intended to be.  <br/><br/>The Bilderbergs have plans to make all humankind slaves to their edicts and laws. Slavery in ALL WAYS forms or fashions are to be punished. Those who compose schemes to do so should stand trial before good international judges hired by us in seven new federal courts instituted by us in and around DC and New York and be sentenced to the maximum penalties. <br/><br/>The Bilderbergs have been empowering human stupidity that has been the plan for a long time to make a way to deceive all. For many to just roll over, moan and groan but do nothing about the crimes against our fellow Americans and this earth citizens.  <br/><br/>Those that might be on the lookout for the Bilderbergs future--- as you read this --- if the shoe fits just wear it. We will see you in court as you try to defend yourself soon.  <br/><br/>If any of us should be so carefree to deny the TRUTH that is plan and obvious, then just look in your rear view mirror for they are in hot pursuit to get ALL of us. WE the once free have been selected to have a ball and chain put on us to work for free with just a morsel of bread a day and maybe a cup of clean water to drink.  Then for us that have grandkids that come along they will be swept away like Hitler did to be schooled in the acts of terror against whom you might ask?   Just look in the mirror. <br/><br/>Our enemies are within…the thieves are trying to rob us blind…the old guard called the crowd or the Bilderbers are leading the way…they are not civil sound or even in my estimation human.  They all tell lies…the pack of them could not put together a good puzzle…they are want to be elites drinking from the same well that Hitler, Stalin, and all the Bush Bunch did.  And if there is a road destined for hell that bunch is in high gear to get there. <br/><br/>Now the good news is … the Bilderbergs seemed victory is NOT on the way, for the good of us have decided to stand up shout out enough of the madness and right behind us is the Sheriff and his posse that has handcuffs in hands and is going to lock up David Rockefeller [he is known by the Bilderbergs to be KING OF THE WORLD] and Henry Kissinger [his words proves he is the worst war criminal of all time] … then start down from the top of the list next [the many in the Presidents Administration] till it bottoms out. We believe about 5 to 7 thousand that are the lawless bunch and their words and deeds right now prove it without a doubt. <br/><br/>We are taking the lead by waking up standing up and shouting out stop the madness. <br/><br/>Do the right and just thing JOIN IN.  <br/> <br/>The PLAN --- We The People Advocates WTPA are providing the only HOPE in saving our great nation.  So JOIN IN and ENLIST to serve with your VOICES being heard and your VOTES being counted and moved along to our lobby group in Washington DC to power push the peoples needs, wants and wishes in our cities, states and Federal Governments for all Americans to have the rights to life in all ways in equity adjudicated by the Bar of Justice.

      True campaign finance reform to create a level playing field for candidates that can get sufficient campaign contributions and signatures (say $5.00 per person) is certainly worth trying before we dump the Senate (House of Lords). Every taxpayer contributing $5.00 or $10.00 when they file state and federal tax forms and no other dollars permitted other than the $5.00 to assist a person trying to get sufficient signatures in order to make the voting slate. The money would have to be divied up to cover all offices, local, state and federal. Television and radio time would be allotted to every legitimate candidate and no more time allotted just because a person has personal wealth or big contributors to supply the backing. Removing the money won't cure all the problems but it certainly would help to remove the undue influence that money and cronyism has exercised over our electoral politics.

      I have to say the the "elimination of the Senate" is ONE reason not to support this topic... <br/><br/>The role of the Senate is to give equal representation to each State.  If all we had was the House, then ideas from the populist states (California, New York) would trump the ideas and philosophies of the smaller States.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately you're under some false idea that we live in a pure Democracy.  We DON"T!!!  The US Government was formed under the idea of a Representative Democracy.  There is a big difference.  <br/><br/>Why not eliminate both the House AND Senate and just have a website we as individual citizens logged into to place our vote for a particular issue/bill?  That would be pure Democracy!

      I agree with most of the principles expressed but...<br/><br/>(a) I think that getting at the truth about the past, and passing laws to prevent similar abuses in the future, is more important than punishment. You want prosecution of Bush, Cheney, et al. I would gladly offer them immunity from prosecution in exchange for full cooperation in revealing exactly what was going on. (Remember, if they perjure themselves, immunity is revoked.) This approach might yield better information, and be more politically palatable as well.<br/><br/>(b) You're asking for 8 constitutional amendments? These are not easy things to pass...<br/><br/><br/>

      One major problem with immunity, especially for the principals in the commission of serious crimes, is that there's no deterrent.  How would we be better off as a society if we acknowledged in detail horrific criminal acts and then declined to hold anyone accountable?  That would be a tacit acceptance of the idea that certain crimes are acceptable as long as we acknowledge them.  High government officials would be free to do whatever they like in office without fear of any consequence more serious than public exposure.<br/><br/>I don't recall anyone suggesting publicizing the murderous acts directed by Charles Manson as a reasonable – even preferred – replacement for investigation and prosecution of his crimes.  But somehow, this has become an accepted line of reasoning in discussing the crimes of Bush and Cheney, who are responsible for more death and misery than Manson could even dream about.<br/><br/>This double standard is widespread, and evident to anyone who's ever tried to talk his way out of a ticket for not wearing a seatbelt, but is particularly outrageous when you consider that Troy Davis is on death row trying to argue that he should be allowed to present evidence of his innocence that has surfaced since his trial.  He’s not even asking to be released.  He’s just asking to present the new evidence in court and has been turned down at every appeal.  The argument of the appeals courts has been that he had an opportunity to present this evidence at trial and missed it.  Now it’s too late.  They didn’t even rule on the actual evidence of innocence, which they acknowledge is compelling.<br/><br/>So, in the United States, it’s apparently too late to present evidence of innocence when a regular citizen is facing death, but too upsetting to even investigate, much less prosecute, high officials for horrific criminal acts that led – among many other things – to the deaths of over 4000 American troops, over a million Iraqis, as well as misery and mayhem all over the region. <br/><br/>The idea that upholding the law for government criminals would damage the country, but that allowing these officials to get away with murder, torture, kidnapping, and cover ups is a way for the nation to heal is astounding.<br/><br/>Allowing high level officials to break the law with impunity is a characteristic of tyrannies, not democracies. <br/>

      Include the revolving door between government and industry.  Much of this is nothing more than a fanciful dream, but stranger things have happened, so add as much as you can so some of it might stick.<br/><br/>Regarding the destruction of the World Trade Center, my SWAG is the Mossad agents dancing and singing on the other side of the river set the charges and had the detonators, because they weren't there just to look.  Read Vickor Ostrovsky's books "By Way of Deception," and "The Other Side of Deception," to understand my answer.  Speaking of the Mossad is not antisemitic.  This ought to draw some hate.<br/><br/>On a side note about that day, jet fuel does not burn hot enough to melt steel, fire does pulverize concrete and fire does not naturally burn downward, especially with discontiguous fuels without a strong wind.  After the initial explosion, the aircraft fuels were negligible.  There were no strong down drafts reported that day, both in or out of the buildings.

      Panther, I think there are certainly enough valid questions, that a more thorough investigation of 9/11 would contribute to the openness this site is trying to get at!<br/><br/>Personally, I wonder how a huge, lumbering jumbo jet could get through what is probably the most heavily protected airspace on the planet, when the military was presumably on its highest alert (it was an hour after the government knew we were under attack), and still manage to get through and hit the pentagon. It kinda makes you hope there was some nefarious explanation, because otherwise, our defense system appears to be worthless!

      Enough preaching to the choir.  Anyone who has gotten this far already knows the Fruit Loop story.  The question is how to get it out of these obscure little forums and onto the front page.  If you don't like the idea of finding Dubbya's boyfriend, maybe we can find some other angle that is less socially acceptable than mass murder and genocide.  Maybe if someone threatened a pretty child during the process.  Or neglected to say his prayers on Sept 10th.

      Tttahiti  and ALL <br/><br/>Why do we need a front page?  And the preaching to the choir is a needed thing to do for many in the choir still got a cotton ball [called nonsense in their ears].  And has far as a good forum this one beats all other hands down. <br/><br/>Now the cotton ball called nonsense is denial.  Right after Obama was elected I had a good big fat one in both of my ears denial.  I thought believed took a breather just knowing what he said he would do he would. <br/><br/>Guess what big cotton balls had to be pulled out again time to defend our Great American Ship called Freedom. When he put the bilderbergs on staff too much nonsense for me. Time to wake, stand up, shout out stop the madness to all that I knew----- still doing that right here today.  But guess what this is our Front Page. <br/><br/>Not going to get any better than this until we take back control of our Federal Government and that is in the making right now.  When the Declaration of Independence was made known only 3.8 percent of the people in America bought in and put some skin in the game. <br/><br/>Why should we expect more?  They were rugged in that day, most had a pioneer spirit in them, and most cared heat and most packed also openly for all to see.  Yet on this forum most will not even show their real name, WHY. Some of what those folks had then-----we simply do not have today. Yet we are still good sane and want to good forward to rid our nation from this curse.  I don’t fear them for we are many and they are few.  The e-mail address is dbaker007@stx.rr.com contact that and get the business plan for the WTPA.  Tells all down to the last little bit. So if fright has not rob you of your sight get one ----- then pass around to all you know. That is how a grass root makes the front page today. <br/><br/>NOW READ CLOSELY ---- to make all of this madness STOP in its tracks will only take arresting TWO of the worlds biggest creeps. David Rockefeller number one and Henry Kissinger number two, to do that is a doable deal as soon as we go to Capitol Hill and demand our rightful place in our government. <br/><br/>Now as far as fear-------- and respect <br/><br/>I respect all of mankind for I am one too. <br/>I fear no man for my God is in me and with me to defend. <br/>I fear my God for I let him down for often times I have believed lies too. <br/><br/>For those that really care and want more for all of us TODAY and to guard our posterity from being vanquished ---- get a business plan. <br/>

      Dream on, cowboy.  <br/>(I was hesitant to use that word, so I looked for a clue as to your gender.  Alas, a lot of people don't like to use their names.)<br/>A lot of people have been doing a lot of screaming and organizing for a very long time.  Grass roots movements do NOT make the front page unless someone upstairs allows it.<br/><br/>The only kind of message that can get through must be simple and, on the surface, inoffensive.

      tttahiti<br/><br/>This is a forum---I would hope it might be open for debate. I do not know about [one moon circling] I do know this men and women have been doing this kind of thing for a long time. And I am tame compared to some of those. Besides this should be an open forum not the finished product. The finished product is as you stated inoffensive polished to the max but real clear in content and purpose. Now as far as screaming and organizing I could care less---I get about 50 to 100 DONATE TODAY nonsense stuff per day that gives no real hope at all. WHY seems no one wants to step out in the demension where we must trek. We are under seige and unless we fight back with words now in a communed group we will all fail. Now cowboy maybe --- I was raised to know right from wrong and have practiced that all my life. In doing I have 13 USA patents to prove it. I have studied and studied more than most traveled the world---spent years in oil and gas---I know the score better than most. I have worked for myself and worked as many as four companies at one time---met payrolls on time never stold a dime. <br/><br/>But is it I that could be a problem here? Is this forum dead set on the acts of exclusion or is this forum about inclusion? <br/><br/>So it is not me you should fear for I am on your side it is those that come to you with polished lies that you should run from before that take our life, limb and all your property.

      Sorry, went a little overboard there.  I had just come from... well, never mind my mood at the time.  The point is that my comment was unnecessary.  <br/><br/>Anyway, about that cotton ball story, no, I don't call that denial.  I call that "hope" and "giving the guy a chance."  I got a couple months of hope out of the deal.  I don't think it's unreasonable that you or I waited for concrete proof that Obama wasn't going to save us. It was nice while it lasted, but now we know.<br/><br/>As for that "skin" thing, everybody on the planet has something valuable at stake right now.  Only it's not a game anymore.<br/><br/>I just don't see a way to take back control of our Federal Government when the majority don't know how out-of-control it is.  Without a free media, there's just no way to reach them.

      We are more than any can imagine we that are sane good to the core honest forthright and do the right thing.  Go to http://www.care2.com/c2c/people/profile.html?pid=664781840 when there take a look at the top of the numbers of folks that are on CARE2.  Then do the math X 2 or 4 = that should represent the numbers in each family that go there to chime in. <br/><br/>Now the present con being run as always is done is that we have NO VOICE and simply is not true --- that is a lie to limit us from hooking up to take charge. NOW any one that wants to business plan have no fear--- I am trustable and when I get a request I send back the plan and that is that no more from me on my end.  Nothing saved nothing passed around just doing my job and that is all. <br/><br/>I hold NO animosity toward anyone about anything HELL we got to help one another. I make mistakes everyday--- I am human.  We got to hold onto each other then walk hand in hand to take back our great and abundant America our ship called Freedom.  <br/><br/>I don’t fear them at all---not to say that I did at one time---then I hit the brick wall and looked around and what I say was me and I didn’t like me at all.  WHY I had become fearful for no reason except the fear of being taken out before I could say my last good byes. Got that all taken care of the next day best as I could so then back on the march to take back our Rich and Abundant America. <br/><br/>Most know by now that I am a RAW FACTS GUY but let me give you a little insight into specifics ---- I have three sons they have sons I had a strong willed Dad that is now gone, he come from a Clan that would get in anyone’s face that tried to intimidate. <br/><br/>Not long ago TIMMY GEITHER was in front of Congress---doing his stuff—Lying to beat the drums for the Bilderbergs.  Behind him set his son---watching every move that stupid dad made and said.  Who sent the son to watch Daddy Tim ---was it grandpa---David Rockefeller--- Henry Kissinger just who and why and what for?  That bunch in running scared.  Now we must learn to read in between the lines as I just said and be ready willing and able to take them on when the time is right ------ Now guess what the time is right -----RIGHT NOW. They are running scared. <br/><br/>And when we get to Capitol Hill with our claims to take back our government the first thing to do is arrest just two to bring down the whole clan of need for greed morons ----David Rockefeller then Henry Kissinger with them locked behind bars in  jail no bail then BUSH BUNCH and others will all run off to Argentina where Moron Bush one and Moron Bush two own 900,000 acres---that is where all war mongering criminals go. History tells us so.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
