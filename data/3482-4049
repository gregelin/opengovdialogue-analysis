  Community development data as constituted is generally in no order, it is not indexed, and it is very difficult to find and put to use.  We need a "one-stop shopping" site on the Web, for community development information.   Information is not sorted in the order clients expect to find it.  We need a "one-stop shopping" Website for community development.  Many of these tasks are already addressed, in some small way, somewhere on the Web. This needs to be centralized, so that people can find info right away,  instead of having to know exactly what to look for.  This website would include at least:<br/>* an "index", listing all major subject areas and keywords. How can one possibly find things without an index?<br/>* within each subject area, a "hot link" area to useful websites. As one example, many people interested in economic development have  never heard of "Business  Incubators", so they would never dream of  tracking down  www.nbia.org, the National Business Incubator Association.  Many people have useful information.  Were this  puzzle assembled- just of useful info that already is out there, it would be useful to all. <br/>* a "community bulletin board" area, sorted by area of the  country, state, city, and neighborhood, so that anyone involved in making community projects happen could advertise the project, and solicit donations of money, material and time.  There is a site on the web that tries to do this, but how do you find it?  This site would have a special section  for computers, so that companies could find local nonprofits  to transfer excess equipment to.  www. volunteermatch.org   http://www.helping.org/volunteer/ are good models of what is possible here.  freecycle and similar sites would be listed here.<br/>* a resource list, which would cite the best books, media  resources, and so on, with reviews by site users, perhaps similar to how Amazon.com [cited only as a comparison, no endorsement implied], similar sites, and www.globalideasbank.org does- or perhaps even partner with Amazon and similar sites.  This list would be user-driven as much as possible.  It doesn't get much easier than a resource list that "writes itself".<br/> * A Best Practices section, sorted by keywords [such as "computer center", "job creation", "microenterprise"], and  region, state, city, and neighborhood.  <br/>There may be other websites doing everything cited  in this, but there is no one site putting them all  together.  <br/>* an events calendar, with events sorted by keywords and  subject, and region, state, and city. This should be client-driven.  I'd recommend web submission, with  direct uploading to an Oracle or SQL server database, with  immediate posting to the Calendar website   When.com used to be a rough model for what I mean [no endorsement implied, cited for comparison only].  <br/>There is a good analogy to this.  In the early 1920's, roads were for short distance  travel, in the minds of most people.  There was the "Albany road", for example.  However, road maps were published, in that decade.  Without adding a single new mile of road, they shifted the paradigm of roads: roads were clearly visible on the map as long roads, and in that decade people started making long trips, because their new paradigm told them they could.  Most community development personnel don't have a lot of extra time for finding difficult to locate information,  totally aside from not even knowing what to look for.  We need a "road map" to the incredible  wealth of community resources available.  <br/>That website needs to have a suggestion area for new ideas, just as with this website I write on. Many community development activities are extremely dependent on volunteers.  Students would be more willing to volunteer their time if they could get college credit for their volunteer work- why not have a central place to document this, in collaboration with all colleges.  The Renaissance & Enlightenment were not driven by a lot of new ideas, not at first- they were driven because the printing press spread already existing ideas far and wide. <br/>A man named Aldus printed every ancient book he could find.  We can do the same with this Website- just having "one-stop shopping" alone would cut a lot off the time necessary to plan community programs, and be the equivalent of adding 10-20% more employees, because they have to waste so much time finding basic information. www.indev.org [no endorsement implied] used to do this on a smaller scale for India.  We need Community Learning networks, a larger scale of what was done in one library, where any patron could simply fill in a form, declaring that s/he would like to learn, teach or share something (anything).  The forms, with appropriate subject headings, were put in the card catalog.  When other patrons searched the card catalog, they found not only books and cassettes, but fellow patrons who had something to share.  With virtually no promotion, dozens of entries came in, reflecting the impressive (and unpredictable) diversity of the community.  Three people offered to teach French--one of whom was simply a transplanted woman from Quebec who wanted to invite people over to lunch so she could speak her native tongue.  One was a childhood friend of James Michener, who wanted to talk about his lifelong pal.  People wanted to share or exchange vegetarian recipes, dress patterns and local historical anecdotes.  Any and every community is a treasure trove of learning resources.  What is often missing is a safe, convenient and respectful mechanism to help people to identify and share these resources.  A public library is a particularly appropriate venue for this, though other places would work.  Libraries are committed to providing a full range of resources to support self-directed learning.  One valuable set of resources exist in the patrons themselves.  Libraries and their communities would be  well served by a "paradigm shift" which viewed each patron as a potential _source_ of information and learning, and not just as a _consumer_ of information and learning.  And, if they were committed to this perspective, which is fully consistent with their mission, libraries would be much more useful and relevant to the communities they serve--and members of the community would benefit immensely.  Neighborhood.com [no endorsement implied] used to be something of a model for what is possible, and may still be.  Statements, conclusions, surveys, reports, and tools presented should be considered to be in draft form, working papers, and do not necessarily reflect the position, policy, or views of any agency, organization, Union, or department.  Information is preliminary and advisory, and must be refined and developed, especially in conjunction with local conditions, before being implemented.  Surveys, reports and tools are included only as examples, rough models of a few representative surveys, reports, and tools.  This material can only be a seed, a "piece of the pie" of a larger effort at building capacity.  No endorsement or sole source status is implied or stated by anything in this.  <br/>

      I could not agree more. When we were creating Shaping America's Youth it was clear to me that while there is good information on the web - the average user has no idea how to find it! Very good information on childhood obesity was lost and imbedded so deeply in sites that it was never used by whom it was intended. We created a web portal to encourage collaboration amoungst users, provided links to pages within government, private and non-profit sites that had good information and tools. There is such waste in recreating the wheel, you can find hundreds of sites with the same information and resourses should be spent on collaboration and sharing so money can be saved and used on new approaches.
